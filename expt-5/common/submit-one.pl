# submit-lines.pl <cogserver-host> <cogserver-port> <observe-cmd>
#
# Read lines from `stdin` and submit them to the cogserver for
# processing. Each line is quoted and then wrapped by the <observe-cmd>
# before being sent. For example, if the line is "some text\n", and
# <observe-cmd> is "do-thing", then the CogServer will receive
#
#   (do-thing "some test")\n
#
# Note that the trailing newline is chopped off the end of the line,
# and "do-thing" is assumed to be a scheme function that has been
# defined.
#
# By convention, each line is assumed to be a single sentence. If
# sentence-splitting is needed, it must be done at an earlier stage.
#
# For word-pair counting, ARGV[2] is "observe-text"
# For MST disjunct counting, ARGV[2] is "observe-mst"
# For planar MST disjunct counting, ARGV[2] is "observe-mpg"
#
# Example usage:
#    cat file | ./submit-one.pl localhost 17001 observe-text
