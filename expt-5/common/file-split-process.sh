#
# Support script for processing of files containing paragraphs of text.
#
# Sentence-split each paragraph into individual files, and submit it,
# via perl script, to the cogserver. When done, move the file over to
# the $COMPLETED_DIR directory.
#
# This script is handles the case for text files that are organized into
# conventional paragraphs, with multiple sentences per paragraph. Such
# paragraphs have to be split into distinct sentences before further
# processing. If the text file already has one sentence per line, then
# sentence-splitting is not needed, and `file-nosplit-process.sh` can be
# used.
#
# <lang> is the language to use for determining sentence boundaries.
# <file> is the file to process
# <base-path> is the directory in which the test corpora are located.
#
# Example usage:
#    ./file-split-process.sh en foo.txt
#    ./file-split-process.sh en /home/data/dir/foo.txt /home/data/
