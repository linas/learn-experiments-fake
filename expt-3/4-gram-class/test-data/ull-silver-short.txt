he has missed his birthright .
Eric Marshall and David Baker walked away together .
physically the two men bore no resemblance to one another , although they were second cousins .
he was a rich man 's son , with a clean young manhood behind him and splendid prospects before him .
he had won his way to success through difficulties and drawbacks which would have daunted most men .
thirteen years later he graduated with high honors from Queenslea Medical College .
he had followed Eric 's college course with keen , watchful interest .
yes , I am going into the business .
why , I 'm full of it it 's bubbling in every pore of me .
I mean to make the department store of Marshall & Company famous from ocean to ocean .
father started in life as a poor boy from a Nova Scotian farm .
he has built up a business that has a provincial reputation .
I mean to carry it on .
in five years it shall have a maritime reputation , in ten , a Canadian .
I want to make the firm of Marshall & Company stand for something big in the commercial interests of Canada .
Whew , this street takes it out of a fellow !
what could have possessed our ancestors to run a town up the side of a hill ?
I 'm not so slim and active as I was on MY graduation day ten years ago .
times have changed with a vengeance , judging from the line-up of co-eds to-day .
by many she is considered the beauty of her class .
I don't greatly care for that blonde , babyish style of loveliness I prefer Agnes Campion .
she 's not hard to find .
nine out of ten girls in this country of ours are fit for kings ' palaces .
perhaps she overdid the worrying business a little , but she was perfectly right in principle .
but he checked himself .
and it is precisely such unchancy happenings that make the scheme of things go wrong .
I liked her looks , that I did .
she is as good as engaged to Larry West .
he is working his own way through college , you know .
for the past two years he has been teaching school in some out-of-the-way place over in Prince Edward Island .
I haven't heard from him since February .
I hope Larry won't break down .
well , here we are .
I must mosey up to the North End to see a man who has got a lovely throat .
nobody can find out what is the matter .
he has puzzled all the doctors .
Mrs Williamson is She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed .
I am not to be allowed to do any work until the fall .
come over and take the school till the end of the term , you petted son of luxury .
the work isn't hard , though you 'll likely find it monotonous .
of course , this little north-shore farming settlement isn't a very lively place .
he is an amusing old gossip , with a turn for racy comment and a finger in everybody 's pie .
he knows everything about everybody in Lindsay for three generations back .
you will never be forgiven and he will not consider you a fit person to have charge of the school .
Mr Marshall , Senior , came in , just as Eric was thoughtfully folding up his letter .
she had died while still young , when Eric was a boy of ten .
and then those girls were as pretty as pinks , now weren't they ?
Agnes was the finest-looking of the lot in my opinion .
he hectored me all the way home from the college on the subject .
there has never been one since your mother died .
I am tired of housekeepers .
but you never LOVED any woman until you met my mother .
I know that , father .
let's drop the subject , father .
he was a decent fellow .
but I am not going over in search of excitement .
go if you 'd like to .
you need a rest after the grind of examinations before settling down to business .
however , I expect your mother 's son to behave himself in the fear of God and man .
the whole world seemed to have fallen , for the time being , into a pleasant untroubled dream .
it is an exhilarating thought .
Larry must certainly have possessed a marked gift for organizing and drilling .
I feel as if I were merely a big cog in an orderly machine that ran itself .
they may make things more interesting .
his opening sentence made Eric 's face twitch mutinously whenever he recalled it during the day .
the distant hills and wooded uplands were tremulous and aerial in delicate spring-time gauzes of pearl and purple .
Eric admitted that he was .
Mrs Reid reflected that this young man had a way with him .
Eric surveyed them with some curiosity .
they did not look in the least like the ordinary run of Lindsay people .
he was evidently tall , with a spare , ungainly figure , and stooping shoulders .
indeed , the idea of smiling could not be connected with this man it was utterly incongruous .
Eric did not disturb this belief , although he said nothing to contribute to it .
the Williamsons were at tea in the kitchen when Eric went in .
Eric liked her greatly .
old Robert Williamson sat opposite him , on a bench .
when he spoke his voice was as thin and squeaky as he appeared to be himself .
keep any of the youngsters in ?
that 's a foolish way of punishing them , as hard on yourself as on them .
one teacher we had four years ago used to lock them in and go home .
then he 'd go back in an hour and let them out if they were there .
they weren't always .
Tom Ferguson kicked the panels out of the old door once and got out that way .
don't beat him too often , even if you can .
he tries to run on every new teacher and he 's run two clean out of the school .
but he met his match in Mr West .
it 's effective .
take some preserve , Master .
mother , Aleck says old George Wright is having the time of his life .
he 's on a regular orgy , Aleck says .
I reckon the man you mean is Thomas Gordon .
HE won't be troubling you with invitations up , small fear of it .
no , sir !
you 've hit the nail square on the head .
Italyun , yes , sir !
the country was swarming with them then .
a baby was born the next day , and the woman died .
the Gordons were left with the fine youngster to their hands .
anyhow , they kept the baby .
he 's always lived there .
they did well enough by him .
some folks think they made too much of him .
Neil 's smart and a great worker , they tell me .
but folks hereabouts don't like him .
but they say he takes sulky spells when he hasn't a word to throw to a dog .
you know the Gordons ain't like other people and never were and never will be .
Lord , Master , think of it !
what chanct would a poor mouse have ?
none of the rest of us are queer , leastwise , we hain't found it out if we are .
there , give your old man a cup of tea and never mind the way his tongue runs on .
so they stuck it out , on opposite sides of the parlour .
Mrs Foster says she never spent such an uncomfortable afternoon in all her life before .
she would talk a spell to one and then t'other .
master , you ain't eating anything .
my hired boy went home to-day .
shortly before sunset that evening Eric went for a walk .
the farms ran back from them into solitudes of woods and pasture lands .
the ghosts of these things seem to linger in their old haunts through many empty years .
old paths were still visible , bordered by stones and large pebbles .
between them was a bed ablow with the starry spikes of June lilies .
along the fence rosebushes grew , but it was as yet too early in the season for roses .
he had a wide outlook to the west , over far hazy fields and misty blue intervales .
Robins were whistling , clear and sweet and sudden , in the woods all about him .
I wonder if perfume could set a man drunk .
Eric started up and listened .
was he dreaming ?
then a very natural curiosity overcame him .
and who was playing so here , in this deserted old orchard , of all places in the world ?
her eyes were on the faraway horizon and she did not see Eric .
for a few moments he stood there and looked at her .
her loveliness was so perfect that his breath almost went from him in his first delight of it .
her skin was as fine and purely tinted as the heart of a white rose .
the sudden change that swept over her was startling .
every hint of colour fled from her face and she trembled like one of the wind-stirred June lilies .
in his eagerness to reassure her he took an unconscious step forward .
before Eric could recover his wits she had vanished from his sight among the firs .
who was she ?
WHAT was she ?
can it be possible that she is a Lindsay girl ?
now that I have come to think of it , there is something quite uncanny about the place .
anything might happen here .
it is no common orchard for the production of marketable apples , that is plain to be seen .
he glanced about it with a whimsical smile .
the light was fading rapidly and the orchard was full of soft , creeping shadows and silences .
it seemed to wink sleepy eyes of impish enjoyment at his perplexity .
he laid the violin bow down on the old bench .
but I certainly wish she hadn't fled in such evident terror .
eyes like hers were never meant to express anything but tenderness and trust .
all the way home , over fields and pastures that were beginning to be moonlight silvered he pondered the mystery .
what were their names ?
can she be one of them ?
well , there is some bewitchment in the affair .
of that I 'm convinced .
but Eric found that it was impossible to forget all about it .
the girl 's exquisite face haunted him and the mystery of her tantalized him .
but somehow , to his own surprise , he found that he shrank from doing this .
he had planned to go to the harbour the next evening .
one of the lobstermen had promised to take him out cod-fishing .
but instead he wandered southwest over the fields again .
it was still the same fragrant , grassy , wind-haunted spot .
the keenness of his disappointment surprised him , nay more , it vexed him .
naturally a man liked to look at a pretty face .
he called himself a fool and went home in a petulant mood .
the next day was Sunday and Eric went to church twice .
he was well-dressed in a suit of dark blue serge , with a white collar and tie .
he was too obviously dressed up , and he looked coarser and more out of harmony with his surroundings .
for two days Eric refused to let himself think of the orchard .
Monday evening he went cod-fishing , and Tuesday evening he went up to play checkers with Alexander Tracy .
Alexander won all the games so easily that he never had any respect for Eric Marshall again .
Wednesday evening Eric went to the orchard again ; and again he was disappointed .
he went home , determined to solve the mystery by open inquiry .
she looked at Eric with quiet affection in her large , candid eyes .
she had liked Mr West .
their house and barns were burned down and they sold the land to Thomas Gordon and went to live in town .
they 're both dead now .
Mr Connors used to be very proud of his orchard .
I have no idea who she was .
Mrs Williamson did not make an immediate reply .
she laid down her knitting and gazed out of the window as if pondering seriously some question in her own mind .
there is no other house near that orchard and I 've heard she plays the violin .
if it was Kilmeny you 've seen what very few people in Lindsay have ever seen , Master .
and those few have never seen her close by .
I have never laid eyes on her myself .
it 's no wonder she ran away , poor girl .
Eric sat in dismayed silence for a moment .
I never heard anything like it .
she picked up her knitting and fell to work again .
she can hear as well as anybody and understands everything that is said to her .
the truth is , nobody knows much about her .
I suppose the Gordons look on her existence as a sort of disgrace .
for my own part , I think it 's terrible , the way she 's been brought up .
but the Gordons are very strange people , Mr Marshall .
I kind of reproved father for saying so , you remember , but it is true .
they have very strange ways .
and you 've really seen Kilmeny ?
what does she look like ?
I 've heard that she was handsome .
Kilmeny is the niece of Thomas and Janet Gordon .
her mother was Margaret Gordon , their younger sister .
old James Gordon came out from Scotland .
they were kind and honest people , even if they were a little peculiar .
she was friendly and gay and liked social life .
they were real fond of their stepmother , I 've heard .
then , six years after she was married , the second Mrs Gordon died too .
she died when Margaret was born .
they say James Gordon almost broke his heart over it .
she and Thomas just worshipped the child and so did their father .
I knew Margaret Gordon well once .
we were just the same age and we set together in school .
we were always good friends until she turned against all the world .
she had some bitter enemies , but she had some devoted friends too .
that was her way .
those who did love her would have gone through fire and water for her .
everybody who saw her looked at her a second time .
and she was proud , oh , she was very proud .
you couldn't budge her an inch , Master , when she once had made up her mind on any point .
she could sing like an angel and she was very clever .
I wish you 'd light the lamp , Master .
Eric rose and lighted the lamp , rather wondering at Mrs Williamson 's unusual exhibition of nerves .
she was generally so calm and composed .
that 's better .
I won't be fancying now that Margaret Gordon 's here listening to what I 'm saying .
I had the feeling so strong a moment ago .
Margaret had never had a beau before .
she didn't believe in going with anybody unless it was somebody she thought everything of .
and there was nobody in Lindsay she cared that much for .
he was a widower , although he was only a young man .
he had set up store-keeping in Radnor and was doing well .
he was real handsome and had taking ways women like .
Margaret looked lovely that day , so gentle and womanly .
they made as handsome a couple as I ever saw .
I saw that plain enough one time I was there and he brought Margaret home from Radnor Friday night .
I guess they wouldn't have liked anybody , though , who come after Margaret .
they thought nobody was good enough for her .
Margaret always liked to make a display .
I was her bridesmaid , Master .
she wouldn't wear white flowers ; she said they looked too much like funeral flowers .
she looked like a picture .
it almost made me feel frightened .
Margaret had a nice house , and was gay and happy .
then well , Ronald Fraser 's first wife turned up looking for him !
she wasn't dead after all .
the talk and gossip was something dreadful .
every one you met had a different story , and it was hard to get at the truth .
some said Ronald Fraser had known all the time that his wife wasn't dead , and had deceived Margaret .
but I don't think he did .
he swore he didn't .
they hadn't been very happy together , it seems .
her mother made trouble between them .
when she found out Ronald thought her dead she and her mother agreed to let him think so .
but I 've always felt it was true .
Margaret didn't think so , though .
she turned against him and hated him just as much as she had loved him before .
they said he just died of a broken heart , nothing more nor less .
not a soul outside of her own family ever saw her again .
I went to see her , but Janet told me she wouldn't see me .
Janet and Thomas felt the disgrace , too .
he never held his head up again after the scandal .
she was never taken to church or sent to school .
but they didn't see her .
the coffin lid was screwed down .
and they didn't see Kilmeny either .
she must have had a very sad , lonely life .
the name suits her .
she is as lovely and innocent as the heroine of the old ballad .
he tried to put her out of his thoughts , but he could not .
the memory of her beautiful face drew him with a power he could not resist .
the next evening he went again to the orchard .
she was there , bending over the bed of June lilies in the centre of the garden plot .
he could only see her profile , virginal and white .
he stopped , not wishing to startle her again .
he realized her entire innocence and simplicity .
looking earnestly into her still troubled eyes he said ,
all men are not wicked , although it is too true that some are so .
my name is Eric Marshall and I am teaching in the Lindsay school .
I did not bring my violin with me .
but I will bring it to-morrow evening and play for you if you would like to hear me .
but why should she hide them ?
they were as pure and beautiful as herself .
Eric smiled back at her with equal frankness .
but if it is at all damp or unpleasant you must not come .
in that case another evening will do .
he must not let himself think nonsense .
these June lilies are the sweetest flowers the spring brings us .
she looked pleased and interested .
I never thought of it being the same as my dear June lilies .
I am glad you told me .
I love flowers very much .
I could not imagine who or what you were .
she sat down beside him on the old bench and looked unshrinkingly in his face .
then she wrote ,
I was afraid to come back here the next evening .
and yet , somehow , I wanted to come .
I did not want you to think I did not know how to behave .
I sent Neil back for my bow in the morning .
I could not do without it .
I cannot speak , you know .
that is my name .
it would make me feel as if I were not myself but somebody else .
and you do not seem like a stranger to me .
do you know that I was called after my grandmother and she was called after a girl in a poem ?
aunt Janet has never liked my name , although she liked my grandmother .
but I am glad you like both my name and me .
she looked pleased .
but he saw she did not understand him .
it just came as I thought .
it has always been that way .
my violin once belonged to Neil , but he gave it to me .
Neil is very good and kind to me , but I like you better .
the wonder of her grew upon him with every passing moment .
what dear little ways and gestures she had ways and gestures as artless and unstudied as they were effective .
they lingered in the orchard until the long , languid shadows of the trees crept to their feet .
she did not know what a novel meant and had never heard of one .
after mother died Aunt Janet gave me all her books .
Eric nodded .
then she told me all .
but when I did I thought them so beautiful .
her great blue eyes gleamed with interest and delight .
I have read mine over so often that I know them nearly all by heart .
there is always plenty for me to do , helping Aunt Janet about the house .
and then , when I am not helping her , I have my dear , dear violin .
that is all the company I want .
I do not want to go anywhere away from home .
I do not want ever to see strangers or have them see me .
he thought that possibly the consciousness of her defect accounted for this .
yet she did not seem sensitive about her dumbness and made frequent casual references to it in her written remarks .
or perhaps it was the shadow on her birth .
at last the lengthening shadows warned him that it was time to go .
when Eric reached home old Robert Williamson was having a lunch of bread and milk in the kitchen .
he looked up , with a friendly grin , as Eric strode in , whistling .
when it was finished she dropped her bow , and looked up at him with flushed cheeks and questioning eyes .
it is a very beautiful evening .
she clapped her hands , looking like a pleased child .
you are quicker than Neil .
he is almost always puzzled to understand my music , and I am puzzled to understand his .
sometimes it frightens me .
somehow Eric did not like her references to Neil .
he put the thought away from him , and flung himself down on the long grass at her feet .
he could not tell which was the greater pleasure .
her beauty , more wonderful than any pictured loveliness he had ever seen , delighted him .
her music enthralled him .
this child , he told himself as he listened , had genius .
but it was being wholly wasted .
now it was probably too late .
then she drifted into a still sweeter strain .
it is your turn now .
do you remember a promise you made me last night ?
he had no doubts about the poetry .
he read her some of the poems .
then he talked to her of his college days and friends .
the minutes passed very swiftly .
it fell on Eric 's ear with a shock of surprise .
was it possible that it could be removed ?
she shook her head .
she said it would be no use .
when I am pleased or frightened I have made little cries .
but it is only when I am not thinking of it at all that I can do that .
this seemed to Eric more mysterious than ever .
do not look so sorry , my friend .
I must play to you again .
Eric smiled ; but the puzzled look returned to his face many times that evening .
he walked home in a brown study .
but I suppose that is out of the question .
at every meeting her beauty came home afresh to him with the old thrill of glad surprise .
she was never in the same mood twice .
but she was always charming .
all the ugliness of existence had passed her by , shrined in her double solitude of upbringing and muteness .
she was naturally quick and clever .
delightful little flashes of wit and humour sparkled out occasionally .
sometimes innocent mischief glimmered out in the unfathomable deeps of her blue eyes .
hers was the spear of Ithuriel , trying out the dross of everything and leaving only the pure gold .
in manner and outlook she was still a child .
her way of smiling enchanted him .
he knew everything about her life .
she told him her simple history freely .
she often mentioned her uncle and aunt and seemed to regard them with deep affection .
she rarely spoke of her mother .
of Neil , she wrote frequently at first , and seemed very fond of him .
later she ceased to mention him .
once she asked him naively ,
she looked gravely at him .
this was a beautiful , passionate idyl exquisitely told .
but it hurt me , too .
I did not know that a person could like anything that hurt her .
I do not know why it hurt me .
I felt as if I had lost something that I never had .
that was a very silly feeling , was it not ?
but I did not understand the book very well , you see .
it is about love and I do not know anything about love .
but your book teaches that it is a blessing .
it says that it is the most splendid and wonderful thing in life .
but the sun is going down .
time does certainly fly in this enchanted orchard .
I believe you bewitch the moments away , Kilmeny .
will you let me give you this book ?
I should never commit the sacrilege of reading it in any other place than this .
it is an old book , Kilmeny .
this was one of my mother 's books .
she read it and loved it .
see the faded rose leaves she placed in it one day are there still .
she took her pencil and wrote slowly , unlike her usual quick movement .
I shall not need anything to make me remember you because I can never forget you .
I do not want to read it again .
nobody will ever love me .
I have known it for a long time .
mother told me that I was very ugly and that nobody would ever like to look at me .
I am sorry .
I hated to think that YOU would think me ugly .
and that is why I do not want to go out into the world and meet people .
he stared at me so .
Eric 's lips twitched .
Eric 's face went down into the grass .
instead , when he dared to look up he said slowly ,
do not let us speak of this again .
it makes me feel sorry and spoils everything .
I forget it at other times .
never mind about your looks , Kilmeny .
Kilmeny was aware of it , however , and she picked up her violin with a pleased smile .
a girl of eighteen who has never looked in a mirror !
what could have possessed her mother to tell her such a falsehood ?
I wonder if Margaret Gordon could have been quite sane .
it is strange that Neil has never told her the truth .
he looked secretive and suspicious , almost sinister .
plainly nothing was to be found out from him about Kilmeny and her grim guardians .
one evening in late June Mrs Williamson was sitting by her kitchen window .
I always did hate meddling .
but I guess it 's my duty .
overhead in his room , Eric was walking about whistling .
presently he came downstairs , thinking of the orchard , and the girl who would be waiting for him there .
as he crossed the little front entry he heard Mrs Williamson 's voice calling to him .
he went out to the kitchen .
Mrs Williamson looked at him deprecatingly .
there was a flush on her faded cheek and her voice trembled .
perhaps you will think it isn't any of my business .
but it isn't because I want to meddle .
no , no .
it is only because I think I ought to speak .
for a moment an angry flush burned in Eric 's face .
even my husband doesn't know .
but you may do her great harm for all that .
I want you to stop and think about it .
I guess you haven't thought .
Kilmeny can't know anything about the world or about men , and she may get to thinking too much of you .
that might break her heart , because you couldn't ever marry a dumb girl like her .
so I don't think you ought to be meeting her so often in this fashion .
it isn't right , Master .
without a word Eric turned away , and went upstairs to his room .
Mrs Williamson picked up her knitting with a sigh .
Mr Marshall is a fine young man , only a little thoughtless .
now that he 's got his eyes opened I 'm sure he 'll do what is right .
Seth 'll quiet down as soon as he finds he can't run the Master .
he 's a rare good teacher better'n Mr West was even , and that 's saying something .
the trustees are hoping he 'll stay for another term .
Mrs Williamson 's words had torn away the delusive veil with which he had bound his eyes .
he wondered how he could have been so long blind to it .
he knew that he must have loved her ever since their first meeting that May evening in the old orchard .
nothing should part them .
I cannot realize that a month ago I did not know her .
it seems to me that she has been a part of my life for ever .
if she does , she does not know it herself yet .
he consented unhesitatingly .
that evening he went to Mrs Williamson , as she washed her tea dishes in the kitchen .
she looked at him reproachfully .
I suppose it wouldn't be of any use if I had .
an expression of amazement came into the good woman 's face .
she looked scrutinizingly at the firm mouth and steady gray eyes for a moment .
then she said in a troubled voice ,
when he sees Kilmeny he will understand .
Mrs Williamson surveyed the handsome , broad-shouldered young man shrewdly .
I hope you won't have any trouble with Thomas and Janet .
they are so different from other folks there is no knowing .
it was merely thoughtlessness on my part .
possibly they do know already .
they 'd never have let her go on meeting you there if they had known .
I know them too well to think of that for a moment .
that is your best plan , Master .
people say he has a notion of Kilmeny himself .
she watched Eric out of sight anxiously .
Kilmeny must be very pretty to have bewitched him so .
well , I suppose there is no use in my worrying over it .
when Eric stepped through the gap she ran to meet him with outstretched hands , smiling .
she looked down , and a warm blush strained the ivory curves of her cheek and throat .
his heart bounded , for in that blush he recognized the banner of love 's vanguard .
why do you ask ?
you know I am always glad to see you .
I was afraid you would not come .
you did not come last night and I was so sorry .
nothing in the orchard seemed nice any longer .
I couldn't even play .
I couldn't come last night .
some day I shall tell you why .
I stayed home to learn a new lesson .
she nodded again , with a return of her usual sweet composure .
it was a delightful lesson when I once understood it .
I must try to teach it to you some day .
come over to the old bench , Kilmeny .
there is something I want to say to you .
she shook her head almost violently and seemed to be making a passionate , instinctive effort to speak .
you do not understand .
they would be very angry .
they do not want to see any one coming to the house .
and they would never let me come here again .
releasing her hands , she wrote slowly ,
I did not know anything so pleasant could be wrong .
but if it is wrong we must not meet here any more .
mother told me I must never do anything that was wrong .
I didn't stop to think , as the children say .
she shook her head .
and they will never let me come here any more .
Uncomforted , she wrote forlornly ,
I cannot take you to-night because they are away .
they went to the store at Radnor .
two great tears brimmed over in her big blue eyes and splashed down on her slate .
her lips quivered like a hurt child 's .
I promise you that , whatever happens .
Kilmeny lifted her head , and wiped the tears from her eyes .
that is the way they always punished me when I was a little girl .
she allowed herself to smile , but it was a rather forlorn little effort .
she did not cry any more , but her spirits did not come back to her .
when he asked her to play she shook her head .
she started back with a little cry .
a burning colour swept over her face , and the next moment she fled swiftly up the darkening lane .
the sweetness of that involuntary kiss clung to Eric 's lips as he went homeward , half-intoxicating him .
he knew that it had opened the gates of womanhood to Kilmeny .
never again , he felt , would her eyes meet his with their old unclouded frankness .
when next he looked into them he knew that he should see there the consciousness of his kiss .
behind her in the orchard that night Kilmeny had left her childhood .
he walked across it to the wild cherry lane ; but at its entrance he stopped short in sudden dismay .
with a thrill of dismay Eric instantly understood what must have taken place .
it would probably prejudice Kilmeny 's guardians still further against him .
his voice rose to a shrill scream .
and I suppose that you have told her uncle and aunt that she has been meeting me here .
I was going to tell them myself , tonight .
I don't know what your motive in doing this has been .
was it jealousy of me ?
his contempt cowed Neil more effectually than any display of anger could have done .
and you have no business to come sneaking around here either .
Neil sprang forward in his path .
I 'll do anything for you if you will .
I love Kilmeny .
I 'd give my life for her .
I wanted to kill you last night when I saw you kiss her .
oh , yes , I saw you .
I don't care what you call it .
she never would wear the flowers I picked for her any more .
she seemed to forget I was there .
I knew something had come between us .
and it was you , curse you !
it overrode all the restraint of his training and environment .
Eric , amid all his anger and annoyance , felt a thrill of pity for him .
it is not for you to say who shall or shall not be Kilmeny 's friend .
now , you may just as well control yourself and go home like a decent fellow .
the restrained power in his tone and look cowed Neil .
his heart beat as he thought of Kilmeny .
the threats of the latter did not trouble him at all .
he thought the angry outburst of a jealous boy mattered but little .
what did matter was that Kilmeny was in trouble which his heedlessness had brought upon her .
presently he found himself before the Gordon house .
faded green shutters hung on the windows of the lower story .
behind it grew a thick wood of spruces .
Eric knocked at the door , wondering if it might be possible that Kilmeny should come to it .
in any case , he preferred her unsmiling dourness to vulgar garrulity .
he lifted his hat .
Eric walked into the parlour and sat down as bidden .
he found himself in the most old-fashioned room he had ever seen .
the painted floor was covered with round braided rugs .
on the centre table was a lamp , a Bible and some theological volumes contemporary with the square-runged furniture .
what then must have been the power of such a personality in life ?
many things in Kilmeny 's upbringing and temperament became clear to him .
pride and stubbornness are its salient characteristics .
his reflections were interrupted by the entrance of Thomas and Janet Gordon .
the former had evidently been called from his work .
he nodded without speaking , and the two sat gravely down before Eric .
he paused .
Janet still sat in a sort of expectant immovability .
I can explain the matter if you will allow me .
I met your niece accidentally in the orchard three weeks ago and heard her play .
I had no thought of harming her in any way , Mr Gordon .
yesterday evening I asked her to bring me here and introduce me to you and her aunt .
we would have come then if you had been at home .
but I do not ask you to receive me as a friend on my own recommendations only .
I will give you references men of standing in Charlottetown and Queenslea .
I know your father well by reputation and I have seen him .
she has been happy enough .
I know folks condemn us for the way she has been brought up , but they don't know everything .
it was the best way for her , all things considered .
he surprised them out of their self possession at last .
both started , and looked at him as if they could not believe the evidence of their ears .
he was evidently puzzled by this unexpected turn of the conversation , and in grave doubt what to say .
I am well educated and not afraid of work .
there can never be any other .
oh , I 'm not speaking rashly or inconsiderately .
I have weighed the matter well and looked at it from every aspect .
Thomas Gordon drew a long breath that was almost a sigh .
Janet Gordon had hitherto spoken no word .
I admit no real stain where there was no conscious wrong doing .
her grim mouth softened and a flood of repressed tenderness glorified her cold gray eyes .
she is bright and clever and she is not ill looking .
Thomas Gordon stood up , as if he considered the responsibility off his shoulders and the interview at an end .
good evening , Master .
I 'll see you again , and you are free to come and go as suits you .
but I must go to my work now .
she lighted the lamp on the table and left the room .
a few minutes later Kilmeny came down .
she smiled , and went over to the table to write on her slate .
they seemed to think I had done something terribly wrong .
uncle Thomas said he would never trust me out of his sight again .
she seemed pleased and yet sad .
she did not yet dream that she loved Eric Marshall , or that he loved her .
but she was no longer the child to be made a dear comrade of .
a SWEETER WOMAN NE'ER DREW BREATH
Thenceforward Eric Marshall was a constant visitor at the Gordon homestead .
he soon became a favourite with Thomas and Janet , especially the latter .
Eric hardly recognized him the first time he saw him thus animated .
of Neil , Eric saw but little .
he must be taught his place .
to Eric , the days were all pages in an inspired idyl .
he wondered if the universe were big enough to hold his joy or eternity long enough to live it out .
his whole existence was , for the time being , bounded by that orchard where he wooed his sweetheart .
curiosity was rife .
a hundred stories were circulated about Kilmeny , all greatly exaggerated in the circulation .
wise heads were shaken and the majority opined that it was a great pity .
they guessed Neil Gordon didn't like it much .
he seemed to have got dreadful moody and sulky of late and wouldn't sing in the choir any more .
thus the buzz of comment and gossip ran .
Kilmeny knew nothing of gossip .
to her , Lindsay was as much of an unknown world as the city of Eric 's home .
Janet was somewhat dubious at first .
she broke them all the day it first struck her that Kilmeny was going to be bonny .
I might have got one after she died maybe .
you are one of those men who always get their own way .
Eric went to town the next Saturday and picked out a mirror that pleased him .
he and Janet together unpacked the mirror and hung it on the parlour wall .
but Janet did not understand epigrams .
Janet shot a quick glance at the picture of her sister .
Margaret was a strange woman , Master .
I suppose she thought her own beauty had been a snare to her .
that picture doesn't do her justice .
I never liked it .
it was taken before she was before she met Ronald Fraser .
but , Master , three years later it was like her oh , it was like her then !
she looks like her grandmother Margaret 's mother , Master .
her name was Kilmeny too , and she was a handsome , sweet woman .
I was very fond of my stepmother , Master .
when she died she gave her baby to me , and asked me to be a mother to it .
but my heart misgives me at times .
oh , I dare say I am only a foolish old woman , Master .
Janet betook herself to the kitchen and Eric went to look for Kilmeny .
in them she held a white Mary-lily from the orchard .
yet you are halesome and fair to see .
I might go on and quote the next couplet too
but you are not to go into the parlour until I come .
her marvelous loveliness was brought out into brilliant relief by the dark wood work and shadows of the dim old hall .
now , give me your hand and shut your eyes .
he led her into the parlour and up to the mirror .
for a moment she was bewildered .
then she realized what it meant .
the lilies fell from her arm to the floor and she turned pale .
with a little low , involuntary cry she put her hands over her face .
Eric pulled them boyishly away .
this is a truer mirror than Aunt Janet 's silver sugar bowl !
look look look !
she was blushing now , and stealing shy radiant glances at the mirror .
I cannot tell you how glad I am .
it is so dreadful to believe one is ugly .
it hurts just the same every time you remember it .
but why did mother tell me I was ugly ?
could she really have thought so ?
come , let us go back to the orchard now .
we mustn't waste this rare evening in the house .
there is going to be a sunset that we shall remember all our lives .
the mirror will hang here .
it is yours .
don't look into it too often , though , or Aunt Janet will disapprove .
she blew an airy little kiss at her mirrored face and turned from it , smiling happily .
on their way to the orchard they met Neil .
he went by them with an averted face , but Kilmeny shivered and involuntarily drew nearer to Eric .
and he looks so strangely at me , too .
she was still lingering there dreamily when Aunt Janet 's grim face appeared in the shadows of the doorway .
Kilmeny smiled softly .
the older woman 's face softened .
I remember well when I was a girl but that is neither here nor there .
Kilmeny started and a scarlet blush scorched her face .
that , and the expression that flashed into her eyes , told Janet Gordon all she wished to know .
with a stifled sigh she bade her niece good night and went away .
her aunt 's words had revealed to her the hidden secret of her heart .
for was she not dumb ?
Eric noticed a change in Kilmeny at their next meeting a change that troubled him .
she seemed aloof , abstracted , almost ill at ease .
when he proposed an excursion to the orchard he thought she was reluctant to go .
something had come between them .
Kilmeny was sitting on the old bench where he had first seen her .
at first she had blushed painfully but now she had grown very pale .
surely you knew before that I loved you .
Eric said , putting his arm about her and trying to draw her to him .
but Kilmeny only shook her head again .
there was a very determined look on her pale face .
she wrote ,
your world would think you had done a very foolish thing and it would be right .
I shall be very unhappy , too , but that is better than spoiling your life .
Kilmeny grew paler and paler , and her eyes revealed how keenly she was suffering .
Janet listened to his story with concern and disappointment plainly visible on her face .
when he had finished she shook her head .
I can't tell you how sorry I am .
I had hoped for something very different .
I have PRAYED for it .
since you came I had hoped she would have a protector in you .
oh , we will , of course , but it will not be any use .
Kilmeny is as determined as her mother when once she makes up her mind .
when her mother died Thomas and I wanted to take her to church .
we could not prevail on her to go .
it is because she thinks so much of you that she will not marry you .
perhaps her defect can be remedied even yet .
have you ever thought of that ?
he thought so much of the child and he felt terrible about it .
but her mother wouldn't hear of it being done .
there was no use trying to argue with her .
she was a strange woman and a terrible woman in many ways after her trouble .
Margaret never let her out of her sight , not even when she was grown up .
where was there any sin ?
your sister thought herself a lawful wife .
it gives me a shiver whenever I think of it .
I must know the whole truth about Kilmeny .
no living person knows it but Thomas and me .
she doesn't know the truth and you must never tell her .
it isn't a fit story for her ears , especially when it is about her mother .
Janet Gordon locked her hands together in her lap , like a woman who nerves herself to some hateful task .
she looked very old ; the lines on her face seemed doubly deep and harsh .
but I would not have you think she was unlovable .
no , no , that would be doing a great injustice to her memory .
we all loved her .
she was the light and life of this house .
oh , Master , if Margaret was too proud she got it from no stranger .
and her misfortune cut him to the heart .
he never spoke a word to us here for more than three days after he heard of it .
but the mischief was done .
oh , I 'll never forget Margaret 's face , Master !
it haunts me yet in the black of the night .
it was full of anger and rebellion and defiance .
but she never answered him back .
nothing we could do for her softened her .
but she would not speak to anyone .
she just sat in her room most of the time and stared at the wall with such awful eyes .
father sickened and took to his bed .
Margaret would not go in to see him .
then one night Thomas and I were watching by him ; it was about eleven o'clock .
Margaret was sitting in her room all alone in the cold and dark , staring at the wall .
I told her what our father had said .
I pleaded and wept , Master .
master , she wouldn't !
she never moved or looked at me .
Janet Gordon lifted her hands and struck them together in her agony of remembrance .
Thomas , help me up .
I walked behind with the candle .
but her stubbornness wouldn't let her .
it was like some evil power that had gripped hold of her and wouldn't let go .
oh , it was hard and dreadful !
she saw her father die and she never spoke the word he prayed for to him .
THAT was her sin , Master , and for that sin the curse fell on her unborn child .
and they were his last words .
she spoke and wept and was herself again .
we thought then that she would go out of her mind .
indeed , Master , she never was quite right again .
Eric had listened with a gray horror on his face to the gruesome tale .
but you may be mistaken .
it may have been nothing more than a strange coincidence .
possibly something may be done for her .
at all events , we must try .
I have a friend in Queenslea who is a physician .
Janet 's face twitched .
I shall tell him nothing that is not strictly necessary to his proper understanding of the case .
Janet plainly had no faith in the possibility of anything being done for Kilmeny .
I hope that he can , and I know he will do all that mortal skill can do .
she nodded .
the grave little motion had the solemnity of a sacred promise .
the next week David Baker came to Lindsay .
he arrived in the afternoon when Eric was in school .
what scrape have you got into ?
you write me a letter , entreating me in the name of friendship to come to you at once .
you seem to be in excellent health yourself .
I have met in Lindsay a young girl whom I have learned to love .
she can hear perfectly and all her other faculties are entirely normal .
this Eric proceeded to do .
David Baker listened with grave attention , his eyes fastened on his friend 's face .
finally he halted before Eric .
David shrugged his shoulders .
I have one argument that will convince you speedily and that is Kilmeny Gordon herself .
but we will not discuss the matter of my wisdom or lack of it just now .
David frowned thoughtfully .
it is very curious and unusual , but it is not totally unprecedented .
I cannot just now remember whether any were ever cured .
well , I 'll see if anything can be done for this girl .
the next morning Eric took David up to the Gordon homestead .
he could not hide his amazement and Eric smiled to see it .
Kilmeny held out her hand with a smile .
but Kilmeny was charmingly at ease .
he suddenly realized how far Kilmeny had come since then and how much she had developed .
Eric introduced David to the Gordons and then hurried away to his school .
pity succeeded the momentary alarm .
the day seemed interminably long to him .
don't keep me in suspense any longer , David .
To-day has seemed like a thousand years .
that is all there is to it .
the trouble is psychological , not physical .
medical skill is helpless before it .
David frowned dubiously and poked his finger through the hole which represented the eye of the king of beasts .
it isn't very plain to myself .
and it is only a vague theory of mine , of course .
I cannot substantiate it by any facts .
she loves me with all her heart and she won't marry me because she can't speak .
and , in any case , it practically means that there is no hope for her or me .
I thank you for your sympathy and interest , David .
with a groan Eric flung himself on a chair and buried his face in his hands .
it was a moment which held for him all the bitterness of death .
David , with a sigh , returned the crochet antimacassar carefully to its place on the chair back .
no , David , I have lost her .
but the look in her eyes Eric , I felt as if I had murdered something .
she bade me good-bye with a pitiful smile and went upstairs .
I did not see her again , although I stayed to dinner as her uncle 's request .
those old Gordons are a queer pair .
I liked them , though .
they are strong and staunch good friends , bitter enemies .
Eric smiled mechanically .
Janet handed him a little note .
it was very brief and blotted with tears .
you must go away and forget me .
you will be thankful for this some day .
Janet shook her head but went upstairs .
she soon returned .
you know she means it , Master , and it is of no use to coax her .
and I must say I think she is right .
Eric was compelled to go home with no better comfort than this .
in the morning , as it was Sunday , he drove David Baker to the station .
he shook hands with Eric on the station platform .
that afternoon he went again to the Gordon homestead .
but the result was the same ; Kilmeny refused to see him , and Thomas Gordon said gravely ,
it is not as if Kilmeny would ever change her mind .
Tush , Janet , woman , don't be weeping .
do you think tears can wash such things away ?
no , they cannot blot out sin , or the consequences of sin .
Eric went home with a white , haggard face .
he had never thought it was possible for a man to suffer as he suffered then .
what was he to do ?
it seemed impossible to go on with life there was NO life apart from Kilmeny .
he found out how much a man may suffer and yet go on living and working .
Eric went again to the old orchard .
as he crossed the pasture field before the spruce wood he came upon Neil Gordon , building a longer fence .
Neil did not look up as Eric passed , but sullenly went on driving poles .
before this Eric had pitied Neil ; now he was conscious of feeling sympathy with him .
Eric had entered into a new fellowship whereof the passport was pain .
the grass had become ragged and sere and unkempt .
so deep was his abstraction that he was conscious of nothing around him .
he did not hear stealthy footsteps behind him in the dim spruce wood .
Kilmeny had sought the old orchard for the healing of her heartbreak , if healing were possible for her .
years seemed to have passed over the girl in those few days .
she had drunk of pain and broken bread with sorrow .
Thomas Gordon had shaken his head bodingly when he had looked at her that morning at the breakfast table .
maybe it is all for the best , poor lass .
Kilmeny walked through the lane slowly and absently like a woman in a dream .
she stopped quickly and the blood rushed wildly over her face .
all this photographed itself in her brain in an instant .
Eric started up , confused , bewildered , as the voice came shrieking across the orchard .
oh , it is so wonderful !
I had no hope that it would .
Thomas Gordon shook his head .
it is near enough to a miracle for me .
it is awesome , that is what it is .
Janet , woman , I feel as if I were in a dream .
the only difficulty which she seemed to experience was in the proper modulation of her voice .
occasionally she pitched it too high again , too low .
but it was evident that she would soon acquire perfect control of it .
Eric had almost forgotten about Neil in his overwhelming amazement and joy .
I know how I should feel towards a man who took Kilmeny from me .
it is a hard thing , and I do not see what we are to do .
we cannot act as if nothing had happened .
but Neil Gordon solved the problem himself .
I told the wife it was only a lover 's quarrel most like .
she 's been worrying about you ; but she didn't like to ask you what was the trouble .
Eric looked amazed .
what could Robert Williamson have heard so soon ?
you know this was the night the excursion train left .
they cross on the boat to-night special trip .
Lincoln couldn't give us much information .
Lincoln jumped at the chance .
Neil had brought the filly with him , and Lincoln hitched right up and took him to the station .
we concluded him and old Thomas must have had a row .
Eric reflected rapidly .
he was greatly relieved to find that Neil had gone .
he would never return and this was best for all concerned .
not caring to discuss the matter further , Eric left the kitchen .
Timothy , did YOU ever hear the like ?
they couldn't act like other people if they tried .
now that everything was settled Eric wished to give up teaching and go back to his own place .
he resolved to teach until the fall vacation , which came in October , and then go .
Kilmeny had promised that their marriage should take place in the following spring .
I am going to church with Uncle and Aunt after this , and to the Missionary Society meetings .
Eric vetoed this promptly .
the idea of Kilmeny in a boarding school was something that could not be thought about without laughter .
she will belong to your world and not to ours .
that is for the best and we wouldn't have it otherwise .
Eric yielded with the best grace he could muster .
but he went home and wrote a full account of his summer to old Mr Marshall that night .
Mr Marshall , Senior , answered the letter in person .
nothing was said about Eric 's letter , however , until after tea .
when they found themselves alone , Mr Marshall said abruptly ,
I hope you haven't gone and made a fool of yourself .
your wife will have to fill your mother 's place , and your mother was a pearl among women .
do you think this girl is worthy of it ?
it isn't possible !
you 've been led away by a pretty face and dairy maid freshness .
that 's just exactly what David Baker said .
they went around by way of the main road and the Gordon lane .
Kilmeny was not in when they reached the house .
they sat down and talked awhile with Thomas and Janet .
when they left , Mr Marshall said ,
if Thomas Gordon had been a man like Robert Williamson I shouldn't have waited to see your Kilmeny .
Kilmeny was reading on the bench under the lilac trees when they reached the orchard .
as she approached Eric saw with a thrill of exultation that she had never looked lovelier .
her face was flushed delicately with excitement .
Kilmeny held out her hand with a shyly murmured greeting .
then he drew her to him and kissed her gravely and gently on her white forehead .
End of Project Gutenberg 's Kilmeny of the Orchard , by Lucy Maud Montgomery
it didn't seem possible that it could be alive way up there .
but it was .
Peter knew that it was , and he knew who it was .
it was King Eagle .
Peter rubbed the back of his neck , which ached because he had tipped his head back so long .
then he gave a little sigh .
there was Sammy Jay sitting in a little tree just over his head .
I 'm not envious of any bird .
the ground is good enough for me .
Peter 's eyes sparkled .
I supposed everybody knew it .
all birds do .
you see the birds were not willing to be ruled over by an animal .
they wanted one of their own kind .
thus she left matters very much to King Eagle and old King Bear .
they settled all the quarrels between their subjects , and for a while everything went smoothly .
it became harder and harder to get enough to eat .
King Eagle , sitting on the edge of the cliff on the mountain , thought it all over .
he would send a messenger to try to find her .
that one was not feeling well .
another had a pain in his wings .
he darted into the air before King Eagle .
but King Eagle didn't laugh .
they watched him until he was a speck in the sky , and finally he disappeared altogether .
at last a day was set to choose a new king .
he would take no part in choosing a new king .
pretty soon he saw a speck way up against a cloud , a speck no bigger than himself .
it grew bigger and bigger , and at last he knew that it was King Eagle himself .
then he told them that King Eagle was coming .
at least , it seems that way to his friends and neighbors .
yes , Sir , Billy Mink is just as much at home in the water as out of it .
there was some one wearing fur who could fly , and of course Billy Mink couldn't do that .
he said as much to Grandfather Frog one day , as they watched Billy Mink catch a fat trout .
people never know what they can do till they try .
I should love dearly to hear about it .
he looked at Grandfather Frog suspiciously .
Peter wasn't sure .
for instance , he couldn't swim .
it has always run in the Mink family to be smart .
and he was a great traveler , just as Billy is .
Peter Rabbit fidgeted uneasily .
it seemed to him that Grandfather Frog had looked at him very hard when he said this .
but Grandfather Frog just cleared his throat and went on with his story .
Mr Mink would find it and help himself .
in the first place , he didn't have as much as he wanted .
and then again he didn't have it when he wanted it .
the water got in his ears and up his nose and choked him .
and then it was so dreadfully wet !
but he would grit his teeth and keep at it .
after a while he got so that he could paddle around a little .
gradually he lost his fear of the water .
this was great sport , and he quite often had fish for dinner now .
no , Sir , he wasn't satisfied .
whatever Mr Mink did , he wanted to do well .
so he kept trying and trying .
the more he did this , the longer he could hold his breath .
there was only one thing that bothered Mr Mink .
the water was so dreadfully wet !
this was very tiresome and he did wish that there was an easier way of drying off .
but Mr Mink didn't go hungry .
oh , my , no !
she watched him catch a fish .
then she watched him run about to dry off and keep from getting cold , and her eyes twinkled .
Mr Mink didn't know what she meant by that , but the next morning he found out .
hello , Peter Rabbit !
he was rather fond of him , even if he did play jokes on him once in a while .
a few days later Peter happened over to the Smiling Pool for a call on Grandfather Frog .
a mighty chorus of joy from unseen singers rose from all about the Smiling Pool .
Peter knew about those singers .
Peter sat very still on the edge of the bank trying to see one of them .
old Mr Toad paid no attention to Peter , not even when he was spoken to .
he was so absorbed in his singing that he just didn't hear .
then he spied Jerry Muskrat at the other end of the Smiling Pool and hurried over there .
Peter was so full of the discovery he had made that he could think of nothing else .
Jerry looked surprised that Peter should ask such a question .
Peter looked very much chagrined .
tell me about it .
she looked at him sharply .
she was worried .
she had so many things to attend to that she hadn't time to take care of the bugs .
besides , I have learned a great deal right here .
Peter sighed .
somebody laughed , and Peter turned quickly to find Jimmy Skunk .
that sounded like a story .
right away Peter sat up and took notice .
how did he lose it ?
why did he lose it ?
Jimmy Skunk clapped a hand over each ear and pretended that he was going to run away .
Peter jumped in front of him .
Jimmy grinned .
Peter looked properly ashamed for interrupting , and Jimmy started again .
he could imitate any and everybody , and he did .
he could sing like Mr Meadow Lark , or he could bark like Mr Wolf .
he could whistle like Mr Quail , or he could growl like old King Bear .
there wasn't anybody smarter than old Mr Crow .
it 's from him that Blacky gets his smartness .
it didn't take him long to discover that no one else had such a wonderful tongue .
he puzzled over it a good deal himself for a while .
sure enough , his own tongue was different from any of the others .
it was split a little , so that it was almost like two tongues in one .
it 's this little old tongue of mine .
nobody else has got one like it , but nobody knows that but me .
I must make good use of it .
that is , he didn't mean what you or I or any of his neighbors would have called good use .
times were getting hard , and everybody had to work to get enough to eat .
of course that meal was left in a hurry .
one morning Mr Crow discovered Mr Coon just sitting down to a good breakfast .
it is a question which was the more surprised , Mr Coon or Mr Crow .
Mr Coon didn't forget his manners .
he politely invited Mr Crow to sit down and take breakfast with him .
but Mr Crow had lost his appetite .
somehow his tongue felt very queer .
he thanked Mr Coon and begged to be excused .
it was no longer split into a double tongue .
they said that he must have lost his tongue .
it just went all through him .
I don't believe he will , because it is too near the homes of men .
he 's just as fierce as his voice sounds .
he doesn't come sneaking about without a sound , like Tufty the Lynx .
he hunts like Bowser the Hound and lets you know that he is out hunting .
there was plenty to eat , and everybody was on good terms with everybody else .
I can't understand it myself .
Peter shook his head .
you see neither Jumper nor Peter ever have hunted any one in all their lives .
he didn't bother to hunt little people like us when there were big people like Mr Deer .
it always made Mr Wolf feel mean .
he never could hold his head and his tail up after that kind of a hunt .
there was nothing to be proud about in such a hunt .
that was the very first Wolf howl ever heard .
Mr Wolf didn't know this , but he did know that he felt better for howling .
so every night he pointed his nose up at Mistress Moon and howled .
this gave Mr Wolf an idea .
that day he had the longest hunt he ever had known , for the Deer had had fair warning .
you see , he felt that it had been a fair hunt .
after that he always gave fair warning .
instead , he carried it proudly .
all the others hunted by stealth .
he alone hunted openly and boldly .
Mr Lynx and Mr Panther would snarl angrily .
the little people feared him , and the big people hated him because he spoiled their hunting .
but he didn't mind .
sometimes he would howl out of pure mischief just to spoil the hunting of the others .
and Peter did .
grandfather Frog sat on his big green lily-pad in the Smiling Pool and shook his head reprovingly at Peter Rabbit .
he never looks ahead to the future .
so of course Peter seldom worries .
you know Peter dearly loves a story .
that was because he was king .
it was just this way with old King Bear .
of course , he wasn't old then .
he even dared to play jokes on old King Bear .
having so much brought to him , he grew very particular .
yes , Sir , old King Bear grew very particular indeed .
some began to whisper behind his back that he was fussy .
Mr Squirrel was smart .
besides , it was a lot more fun .
it is easy to give what you don't want yourself .
little Mr Squirrel bowed very low and thanked old King Bear in his best manner .
so he took the nuts and pretended to be delighted with them .
at last he remembered a certain hollow tree .
the little forest and meadow people were growing tired of feeding the Bear family .
it didn't take her long to find out .
no , Sir , it didn't take her long .
she took one good look at old King Bear nodding in the cave where he used to sleep .
yes , Sir , they were all asleep , fast asleep .
he grew more lonesome every day .
the weather was cold , and it was hard work to find anything to eat .
Mr Squirrel was hungry all the time .
he grew thin and thinner .
then he went without dinner .
Late in the afternoon he crept into a hollow tree to get away from the cold , bitter wind .
tears filled his eyes and ran over and dripped from his nose .
he curled up on the leaves at the bottom of the hollow to try to go to sleep and forget .
under him was something hard .
he twisted and turned , but he couldn't get in a comfortable position .
finally he looked to see what the trouble was caused by .
what do you think he found ?
six big , fat nuts !
yes , Sir , six big , fat nuts !
then he began to wonder how those nuts happened to be in that hollow tree .
these were the very nuts , the present of old King Bear .
and that is just what he did do .
it isn't often that Peter Rabbit is filled with envy .
as a rule , Peter is very free from anything like envy .
you see , Peter always had been very proud of his own powers of jumping .
why don't you find out how ?
probably Grandfather Frog knows all about it .
he knows about almost everything .
Peter 's eyes brightened as he said this .
Jimmy chuckled .
I don't want to know how Lightfoot learned to jump .
he may jump over the moon , for all I care .
Jimmy laughed .
it was a good-natured , chuckling kind of a laugh .
grandfather Frog was there on his big green lily-pad , and Peter wasted no time .
grandfather Frog blinked his great , goggly eyes .
Peter looked at the Laughing Brook in dismay .
it was quite wide at that point .
Peter hastened to blurt out .
Peter went back a little so as to get a good start .
Jerry Muskrat and Billy Mink rolled over and over on the bank , laughing until their sides ached .
Even Spotty the Turtle smiled , which is very unusual for Spotty .
he paddled for the shore as fast as he could , and in his heart was something very like anger .
no one likes to be laughed at .
Peter intended to start for home the very minute he reached the shore .
but just before his feet touched bottom , he heard the great , deep voice of Grandfather Frog .
his curiosity wouldn't let him .
so he shook himself and then lay down in the sunniest spot he could find within hearing .
when he had the latter , he was not much afraid of anybody .
when he had to run , he wanted nothing in the way of his slim legs .
but there were others who could run swiftly in those days too , Mr Wolf and Mr Dog .
Mr Deer always had a feeling that some day one or the other would catch him .
he felt perfectly helpless then .
yes , Sir , one thing troubled him a great deal .
he couldn't run fast at all among the bushes and the fallen trees and the old logs .
this was a new worry , and it troubled him almost as much as the old worry .
he felt that he was in a dreadful fix .
oh , dear !
oh , dear !
a big log was in his path , and he jumped over it as lightly as a feather .
Mr Deer watched him and sighed .
right then he had an idea .
why shouldn't he learn to jump ?
he could try , anyway .
Mr Deer hung his head .
Jimmy Skunk and Peter Rabbit were having a dispute .
both agreed that they would accept Grandfather Frog 's decision .
you see , each was sure that he was right .
when they reached the Smiling Pool , they found Grandfather Frog looking very comfortable and old and wise .
he looked very hard at Peter Rabbit , for he suspected that Peter had come for a story .
grandfather Frog looked immensely pleased .
it always pleases him to be considered wise .
grandfather Frog shook his head .
I wonder if you ever will learn to use them .
there was so much envy that it got into your eyes , and you couldn't see straight .
Jimmy Skunk chuckled .
he hasn't any wings .
what he does do is to coast on the air .
he used to sit and watch old Mr Bat flying about and wish that he had wings .
he would climb an old stump and then jump as far as he could .
then one night he made a discovery .
it was like sliding down on the air .
it was great fun , and pretty soon he was spending all his spare time doing it .
you know she is always pleased when she finds people trying to help themselves .
he knew that he ought to trust her .
so he climbed the tall tree .
he looked this way ; he looked that way .
Peter saw him and headed straight toward him to pass the time of day .
it was Peter 's turn to look frightened , and he hastily glanced this way and that way .
it must be dreadful to be hated by everybody .
let's ask him .
Jimmy came ambling up in his usual lazy way , for you know he never hurries .
it seemed to Chatterer and Peter that he was slower than usual .
but he got there at last .
Jimmy smiled good-naturedly .
then he settled himself comfortably with his back to an old stump and began .
but all the time he had a mean disposition .
he hid it from his neighbors , but he had it just the same .
being small and moving so swiftly , he was hard to keep track of .
Chatterer and Peter nodded .
they knew that it is because of this that he is called Shadow .
there were no secrets that he didn't find out , and all the time no one suspected him .
so Mr Weasel became a thief , and still no one suspected him .
now one bad habit almost always leads to another .
yes , Sir , that 's what he did .
then he discovered a nest of young mice , and he found these quite as good as young birds .
it makes most people angry to be caught in wrongdoing and it was just that way with Mr Weasel .
so pretty soon Mr Weasel found that he hadn't a friend in the world .
this made him more savage than ever , and he hunted and killed just for the pleasure of it .
he wasn't sorry for what he had done and he wouldn't promise to do better .
and it has been so to this day .
Peter Rabbit shuddered .
Blacky knew that the bright light hurt Hooty 's big eyes and half blinded him .
dear me , dear me , such a racket as there was then !
but all the time they took the greatest care to keep out of sight themselves .
Peter Rabbit was there .
oh , my , no !
you see he knew just how helpless Hooty was .
that interested Peter Rabbit immensely .
he couldn't think of anything else .
he kept trying to do the same thing himself , but of course he couldn't .
he could turn his head sideways , but that was all .
it 's because his eyes are fixed in their sockets , and he can't turn them .
so he turns his whole head in order to see in all directions .
Jumper looked up at the moon to see what time of night it was .
old Mr Owl had them .
she wanted to see just how many of them she could trust to obey her orders .
so she lined them all up in a row .
then she made them turn so that their backs were to her .
old Mr Rabbit just itched all over with curiosity .
it seemed to him that he just must turn his head .
Peter nodded .
so he rolled his eyes back and then looked straight ahead again .
what he had seen made him want to see more .
he tried it again .
he couldn't move them a bit .
all he could do was to stare straight ahead .
he could see in only one direction , the way his head was turned .
he didn't say anything .
he flew away home the very first chance he got .
for a long time after that , Mr Owl never could see behind him at all .
it made him dreadfully nervous and unhappy .
he felt all the time as if people were doing things behind his back .
but he didn't complain .
he was ashamed to do that .
Peter Rabbit was bothered .
it was so now .
he said so .
Johnny Chuck couldn't eat his own fat , so what was the use of it ?
but why wasn't a good thick coat of fur just as good or even better ?
he didn't have any trouble keeping warm .
neither did Billy Mink or Little Joe Otter or Reddy Fox .
no , it couldn't be that Johnny Chuck put on all that fat just to keep warm .
grandfather Frog looked at Peter sharply .
perhaps he read the truth in Peter 's eyes .
I know how I look .
I look old and tired .
Peter looked a little shamefaced .
he didn't know just what to say , so he said nothing and just nodded his head .
grandfather Frog had to smile at the eager curiosity in Peter 's voice .
his was sensible .
once more Peter nodded his head .
then he made himself comfortable and prepared not to miss a word of Grandfather Frog 's story .
everybody had plenty to eat , and everybody was on the best of terms with all his neighbors .
their coming made the first winter .
yes , Sir , it certainly was hard on them .
old Mr Chuck , who , of course , wasn't old then , was one of them .
he had been too cold and too hungry to ever forget .
anyway , it never will be very cold .
I believe that is a good idea .
they shriveled and dried , so that he couldn't eat them at all .
Mr Chuck 's heart sank .
he thought of how soon all the tender green things would disappear .
right then an idea was born in Mr Chuck 's head .
but he didn't mind that .
all the tender green things were black and dead .
back to his bed scrambled Mr Chuck and curled up to sleep just as long as he could .
he made up his mind that he wouldn't worry until he had to .
he had done his best , and that was all he could do .
at length she came to his house and looking inside found him fast asleep .
she knew without being told what it all meant , and the idea amused her .
when he awoke in the spring , he knew nothing of the hard times his neighbors were talking about .
I know , because I have done the same thing for years .
Good-by , Peter Rabbit !
Little Joe Otter was having the jolliest kind of a time .
Little Joe Otter is a jolly little chap , anyway , and just now he was extra happy .
you see , he had a brand new slippery-slide .
of course he enjoyed it more because he had built it himself .
Peter Rabbit and Johnny Chuck sat watching him from the bank on the other side of the Smiling Pool .
my goodness , it makes me feel young just to watch Little Joe shoot down that slippery-slide .
Little Joe was having such a good time !
Peter actually was wishing that he did like the water .
grandfather Frog climbed out on his big green lily-pad .
there was a great deal of eagerness in Peter 's voice , and it made Grandfather Frog smile .
yes , Sir , he certainly did get into a peck of trouble .
it is hard , very hard indeed to be hungry and good-natured at the same time .
Mr Otter knew this .
it was a beautiful morning , and Mr Otter went farther than he intended .
Mr Otter was almost out of breath when he reached the high bank just above the open spring-hole .
Mr Otter threw a hasty glance over his shoulder .
Mr Lynx was so near that in one more jump he would catch him .
there wasn't time to run around to the place where the bank was low .
it was great fun , the greatest fun Mr Otter ever had had .
he did it again and again .
in fact , he kept doing it all the rest of that day .
he learned just how to hold his legs so that they would not be hurt .
right away he tried it .
after that Mr Otter was perfectly happy , for summer and winter he had a slippery-slide .
be content with the blessings you have got , Peter Rabbit .
be content with the blessings you have got .
Drummer the Woodpecker was beating his long roll on a hollow tree in the Green Forest .
Drummer thought it the most beautiful sound in the world .
after each long roll he would stop and listen for a reply .
suddenly Drummer heard a scratching sound inside the hollow tree .
then he heard a voice just a little way above him .
Drummer looked up .
is this your house ?
I didn't know it when I began to drum .
I wasn't knocking ; I was drumming .
I 'll look for another hollow tree , though I don't believe I can find another as good .
it is one of the best sounding trees I have ever drummed on .
in a few minutes they heard Drummer 's long roll .
they could hear Drummer 's voice , and it sounded very angry .
yes , Sah , it cert'nly is a bad habit .
then he began to drum .
Drummer hardly paused for breath .
he was still laughing when he reached the Smiling Pool .
grandfather Frog watched him until he began to smile too .
you know laughter is catching .
they both listened .
there was great eagerness in Peter 's voice .
this time Grandfather Frog took no notice .
he didn't have any sweeter voice than Drummer has to-day .
so Mr Woodpecker lived pretty much alone .
they shrugged their shoulders and went on playing and having a good time .
but Mr Woodpecker was worried .
he said as much to some of his neighbors , but they only laughed at him .
the more he thought about it , the more Mr Woodpecker worried .
from early morning until night he hunted worms and dug them out of the trees .
then he would fly to the next tree .
he pounded with his bill until his neck ached .
he didn't even take time to drum .
she went all through the Green Forest , and her sharp eyes saw all that Mr Woodpecker had done .
she made him sit up on a dead limb of a tall chestnut-tree where all could see him .
old Mr Toad hopped into the shade of a big mullein leaf .
Hot , isn't it ?
I simply can't stand the sun .
old Mr Toad chuckled .
Peter settled himself comfortably and prepared to listen .
old Mr Toad snapped up a foolish spider who came too near and then cleared his throat .
you see , there were no birds in those days to help .
one day little Mr Frog sat under a bush on which most of the leaves had been eaten .
he saw a worm eating a leaf on one of the lower branches .
it was quite a way above his head .
it worried him .
he kept his eyes on that worm and thought and thought until his head ached .
at last he got an idea .
I 'll try it .
it quite knocked the wind from his body .
he had to pull to get it free .
like a flash an idea popped into his head .
you see , she was worried about them .
when she found what the Toads had been doing , she was mightily pleased .
it was little Mr Frog .
he was catching bugs as fast as he could .
then she hid where she could watch .
and she was pleased .
Peter sat and stared at him most impolitely .
he knew that he was impolite , but for the life of him he couldn't help staring .
but Longlegs didn't move .
Peter stared as long as his patience held out .
then he gave up and went on to see what else he could find .
he didn't really expect to find him there , but he did .
so far as Peter could see , Longlegs hadn't moved .
half an hour later Peter was once more back .
there stood Longlegs just as before .
behind that bill was the longest neck Peter ever had seen !
Peter watched until he grew tired , but Longlegs didn't move again .
he spoke of it one day to Grandfather Frog .
at the mere mention of Longlegs , Grandfather Frog sat up and took notice .
grandfather Frog nodded .
grandfather Frog 's eyes took on a far-away look , as if he were seeing into that long-ago past .
he was just as awkward as he looked .
his long legs were in his way .
he didn't know what to do with his long neck .
when he tried to run , everybody shouted with laughter .
some of those who laughed at him would have given anything to have possessed such a beautiful coat .
but Mr Heron didn't know this .
he couldn't bear to be laughed at , wherein he was very like most people .
at first he used to go ashore to hunt for food .
it tasted so good that he wanted more , and every day he went fishing .
sometimes he did , but more often he didn't .
for a long time he stood there , resting .
the water around his feet was cool and comforting .
he was very comfortable but for one thing , he was hungry .
so he kept perfectly still .
he didn't dare even stretch his long neck up .
sure enough , the little fish swam almost to his very feet .
they didn't see him at all .
Mr Heron was almost as surprised as the fish he had caught .
it really was a great discovery for Mr Heron .
he settled himself in great contentment , for now he was less hungry .
grandfather Frog sighed mournfully .
with his neck carried that way , he could fly as well as any one .
Mr Heron himself became proud of them .
you see , he had learned how to use what he had been given .
also he had learned the value of patience .
so he was happy and envied no one .
with a great splash Grandfather Frog dived into the Smiling Pool .
it was then that Peter had seen him .
in fact , Peter had had the narrowest of escapes , and the very memory of it made him shiver .
that tail fascinated Peter .
it was just an apology for a tail .
for Tufty 's size it was hardly as much of a tail as Peter himself has .
it made Peter feel a lot better .
also it made him very curious .
Jumper did know , and this is the story he told Peter :
indeed I do .
he wasn't old then .
no one was old , because it was in the beginning of things .
he was very proud of it .
you know there is a saying that pride goes before a fall .
it was so with Mr Lynx .
he boasted about his tail .
he said that it was the finest tail in the world .
he said so much that his neighbors got tired of hearing about it .
he made a perfect nuisance of himself .
it seemed as if that tail were never still .
Mr Lynx had had a very successful day , and he was feeling very fine .
he was so intent on his boasting that he didn't notice old King Bear slipping around behind him .
then old King Bear let him go .
then he turned and slunk away in the shadows by himself .
after that he kept out of sight of all his neighbors .
he prowled around mostly at night and was very stealthy and soft-footed , always keeping in the shadows .
his temper grew worse and worse from brooding over his lost tail .
you see he would forget .
she gave him a lecture which he never forgot .
he tried , but he couldn't do it .
then he gave up and sneaked away into the darkest shadows he could find .
so Mr Lynx never did get a new tail .
to the little people , he was like a fearsome shadow to be watched out for at all times .
his children were just like him , and his children 's children .
Tufty is the same way .
no one likes him .
but you will notice that he switches it just as if it were a real tail .
he was silent for a few minutes .
Mrs Quack is Distrustful III .
Mrs Quack Tells About Her Home IV .
Mrs Quack Continues Her Story V Peter Learns More of Mrs Quack 's Troubles VI .
what Did Happen to Mr Quack XIII .
Jerry Muskrat 's Great Idea XX .
it means more knowledge .
you cannot meet any one without learning something from him if you keep your ears open and your eyes open .
he knew right away who it was .
Peter was so surprised to see her in the Smiling Pool that he almost forgot to be polite .
I 'm curious right now .
I 'm wondering what brings you to the Smiling Pool when you never have been here before .
Peter 's eyes opened very wide with surprise .
but she thought better of it , and then Peter saw that she was trembling all over .
Peter nodded .
that 's why I just had to find some other place .
Jerry Muskrat thinks there is no place in the world like the Smiling Pool .
you see , they have spent their lives there and know little about the rest of the Great World .
he is such a good friend that he ought to be a Quaddy himself .
you say he fed some of you last winter , but that doesn't mean anything good .
there was a little sob in her voice and tears in her eyes .
Mrs Quack nodded .
it isn't because we want to , but because we must !
there is everything that Ducks and Geese love .
that is perfectly fair , so we don't mind that .
it is only men who are not fair .
they had learned how to take care of themselves just as well as I could .
I certainly was proud of that family .
Mrs Quack suddenly choked up with grief , and Peter Rabbit politely turned his head away .
in a few minutes she bravely went on with her story .
for a while we had nothing much to fear .
perhaps you don't know what marshes are .
Jerry Muskrat 's eyes sparkled .
in some of these we stayed days at a time .
in fact , we stayed until Jack Frost came to drive us out .
if we saw none , we would drop down a little nearer and a little nearer .
but with all our watchfulness , we never could be sure , absolutely sure , that all was safe .
sometimes those terrible two-legged creatures would be hiding in the very middle of the wildest , most lonely looking marshes .
they would be covered with grass so that we couldn't see them .
so we would fly our hardest .
Mrs Quack paused and shuddered , and Peter Rabbit and Jerry Muskrat shuddered in sympathy .
it was like that every day .
our flock grew smaller and smaller .
I am afraid the terrible guns killed some .
in the second place there are more dangers down there for young Ducks than up in the far Northland .
in the third place there isn't room for all the Ducks to nest properly .
tears filled Mrs Quack 's eyes .
we cannot go any faster than Jack Frost does .
Mrs Quack stopped and shivered .
that is what makes me so dreadfully nervous .
then we would have to do it all over again until night came .
if they didn't , they would have a little bit of pity .
I wouldn't trust one of them , not one minute .
Peter sat up and looked across the Green Meadows , and his heart sank .
but Mrs Quack wouldn't wait to see .
it meant that his feathered friends would soon be busy house-hunting and building .
Just then there was a distant bang in the direction of the Big River .
some people haven't any hearts ; they 're all stomachs .
he grinned at the idea , and then he continued his way towards the Smiling Pool .
Farmer Brown 's boy smiled when he saw them .
he felt in his pocket and brought out a couple of carrots .
one he put on a little tussock in the water where he knew Jerry would find it .
presently he noticed two or three feathers on the water close to the edge of the bank .
Mrs Quack had left them there .
and this is just what Farmer Brown 's boy did .
the first Peter knew of her coming was the whistle of her wings as she passed over him .
it was very clear that she was terribly nervous and suspicious .
as she spoke she swam about nervously .
Mrs Quack nodded and held up one wing .
Peter and Jerry could see that one of the long feathers was missing .
it is very hard work to know just how far those terrible guns can throw things at you .
I didn't dare go near either shore , and I 'm nearly starved .
he would let her find it for herself .
if he told her about it , she might suspect a trick and refuse to go near the place .
but he couldn't blame her , after all she had been through .
so he kept still and waited .
he was learning , was Peter Rabbit .
he was learning a great deal about Mrs Quack .
that 's a fact .
but once fill that empty stomach , and everything is changed .
it was just that way with Mrs Quack .
Peter Rabbit looked over at Jerry Muskrat sitting on the Big Rock , and Jerry winked .
she had found some of the corn left there by Farmer Brown 's boy .
he thinks that if I do , he 'll have a chance to hide near enough to shoot me .
I didn't believe this could be a safe place for me , and now I know it .
I 'll stay here to-night , but to-morrow I 'll try to find some other place .
there were tears in her eyes .
Jerry Muskrat sniffed in disgust .
I wouldn't trust many of those two-legged creatures myself , but Farmer Brown 's boy is different .
if all of them were like him , we wouldn't have a thing to fear from them .
he has a heart .
yes , indeed , he has a heart .
now you take my advice and eat whatever he has put there for you , be thankful , and stop worrying .
with the first bit of daylight , Mrs Quack swam out from her hiding-place among the brown rushes .
but he didn't .
he kept perfectly still .
Mrs Quack shook herself and then began to carefully dress her feathers .
that is , she carefully put back in place every feather that had been rumpled up .
he didn't mean to be impolite .
and then it was so interesting .
you know Peter doesn't waste any time on his clothes .
in fact , he doesn't seem to care a bit how he looks .
so he waited as patiently as he could , which wasn't patiently at all .
at last Mrs Quack finished her breakfast , and then she had to make her toilet all over again .
finally Peter hopped to the edge of the bank where she would see him .
this is a very nice place .
at the mention of Mr Quack , the eyes of Mrs Quack suddenly filled with tears .
Peter felt tears of sympathy in his own eyes .
I ought to be on my way there now , but what is the use without Mr Quack ?
he was giving her his sympathy , and sympathy often helps others a great deal more than we even guess .
it was so with Mrs Quack .
Peter Rabbit leaned forward and stared at Mrs Quack with his eyes popping right out .
Mrs Quack just had to smile , Peter was so in earnest and looked so astonished .
by this time Peter 's eyes looked as if they would fall out of his head .
he 's a very interesting old fellow .
Mr Quack and I kept out of his reach , you may be sure .
Mrs Quack 's eyes suddenly filled with tears again .
presently Mrs Quack went on with her story .
Mr Quack was the leader as usual , and I flew right behind him .
Mrs Quack paused and Peter waited .
the very safest-looking places sometimes were the most dangerous .
Peter nodded .
we were tired , for we had flown a long distance , and we were hungry .
my heart almost stopped beating .
I told you that when we started each of us had a mate .
now we found that of those who had escaped , four had lost their mates .
they were heartbroken .
when it came time for us to move on , they wouldn't go .
besides , they hoped that if they waited around they might find their mates .
Mrs Quack drew a wing across her eyes to wipe away the tears .
Peter blinked his eyes rapidly as if he were having hard work to believe what he had been told .
why , some of them have learned our language and actually call us in where they can shoot us .
just think of that !
sometimes awful storms will come up , and we just have to find places where we can rest .
they only hunt when they are hungry , and they hunt fairly .
when , they have got enough to make a dinner , they stop .
they keep our wits sharp .
if we do not keep out of their way , it is our own fault .
we don't have any chance at all .
I 'm sure one would make him a dinner , if that is what he wants .
once more poor Mrs Quack was quite overcome with her troubles and sorrows .
that was where Mr Quack made a mistake .
so to save time he led us close to shore .
and then it happened .
it was awful .
here Mrs Quack choked up so that she couldn't say another word .
I 'm going back to the Big River now to look for him .
if she had heard Mrs Quack say that , I never would have heard the last of it .
I wish there was something we could do for Mrs Quack .
then for a long , long time he sat in a brown study .
a brown study , you know , is sitting perfectly still and thinking very hard .
that was what Peter did .
but he wasn't asleep .
he was just thinking and thinking .
he was trying to think of some way to help Mrs Quack .
at last he gave a little sigh of disappointment .
Peter looked up .
there sat Sammy Jay .
Peter had been thinking so hard that he hadn't seen Sammy arrive .
you know Sammy dearly loves to tease Peter .
Peter made a good-natured face at Sammy .
Peter started to make a sharp retort , but thought better of it .
what 's the matter with her ?
when Peter finished , Sammy flew down a little nearer to Peter .
now I don't say that I can help Mrs Quack , but I can try .
he hoped so .
so he watched Sammy and waited and hoped .
Peter nodded .
again Peter nodded .
he hates terrible guns and the men who use them .
and he knows all about them .
you see , they know that shooting at us would frighten the Ducks .
Blacky knows all about the Big River .
now here is my plan .
I 'll go find Blacky and tell him all about what we want to do for Mrs Quack .
she must swim right up the Big River , keeping out in the middle where she will be safe .
I think your plan is perfectly splendid , Sammy Jay .
now she had that very comfortable feeling that goes with a full stomach , she could think better .
at the time she had been tired and hungry and discouraged .
now she was beginning to feel rested , and she was no longer hungry .
these things made all the difference in the world .
Sammy Jay did the same thing on the other bank .
now Sammy Jay dearly loves to hunt for things .
when he does find it , he usually steals it , I 'm sorry to say .
but it is the fun of hunting that Sammy enjoys most .
so now Sammy thoroughly enjoyed hunting for Mr Quack .
Mrs Quack heard his scream and understood just what it meant .
a little later Blacky the Crow discovered another hunter hiding behind the bushes on his side .
there 's another hunter up where the Laughing Brook joins the Big River !
I guess I won't take any chances .
for some time Sammy sat there watching .
but of course Sammy could see him perfectly , because he was behind him .
he couldn't see any feathers !
no , Sir , he couldn't see any feathers !
then he understood .
they are just pieces of wood made to look like Ducks .
he saw the hunter crouch down a little lower and look down the Big River .
Sammy looked too .
he saw a flock of real Ducks flying swiftly just above the middle of the Big River .
suddenly the leader turned straight towards the place where the hunter was hiding , and the others followed him .
they had their eyes on those wooden Ducks and were coming straight in to join them .
he saw the hunter suddenly rise and point his gun at the flying Ducks .
the distance was too great .
Sammy chuckled happily .
idly he watched it , and presently it moved .
instantly Sammy was all curiosity .
he flew over where he could see better .
it had done this right here in the little swamp where Sammy was .
that green spot had moved .
he was sure of that .
and if it moved , it must be something alive .
if it were alive , it must be somebody , and Sammy wanted to know who it was .
Try as he would he couldn't remember any one who wore such glossy green as that .
so , his eyes sparkling with excitement , Sammy watched .
he was impatiently patient .
did you know that it is possible to be impatiently patient ?
well , it is .
Sammy was just boiling with impatience inside , but he didn't let that impatience spoil the patience of his waiting .
that is what is called self-control .
it is a splendid thing to have , is self-control .
Little by little something reached out from under the pile of brush .
Sammy choked back a little gasp of surprise as a sudden thought popped into his head .
could this be the lost Mr Quack ?
this was just plain boasting , and Sammy knew it .
but Sammy always does have a good opinion of himself .
it is one of his faults .
now that he had guessed who this might be , he was less impatient .
Sammy could keep still no longer .
the beautiful head disappeared like a flash .
there isn't anybody here but me , and I 'm your friend .
one of the hunters would be sure to see her .
Sammy shook his head .
my , won't she be happy when you do tell her !
I wonder what she 'll say and what she 'll do .
I 'm going to stay right here so as to see her when she hears the good news .
in fact , Sammy Jay and Blacky were getting very uneasy .
Mrs Quack nodded her head rapidly .
Mrs Quack looked up at Sammy sharply .
Mrs Quack promised that she would .
wait until it is dark and he has gone home .
both jumped a little .
then both laughed .
Jerry good-naturedly repeated what he had said .
Mrs Quack 's face brightened .
the idea came to me while you were talking .
Mrs Quack 's eyes fairly shone with hope and eagerness .
Jerry 's eyes twinkled .
Mrs Quack 's face fell .
Mrs Quack 's face lighted up again at once .
in fact , they are very good neighbors of ours in our home in the far Northland .
I didn't suppose there was a Beaver pond anywhere around here .
he has got a very nice pond there now .
Mrs Quack waited to hear no more .
she shot up into the air and disappeared over the tops of the trees in the Green Forest .
they know .
you see , the heart of Mrs Quack was true and brave and strong .
so she wasted no time .
she examined every inch of the shore of that little pond .
in it she laid ten eggs .
the broken wing healed and grew strong again , for it had not been so badly broken , after all .
unknown to them , Farmer Brown 's boy discovered where they were .
in fact , after the first few times , he made no attempt to hide .
you see he discovered that Farmer Brown 's boy was a friend .

was she a criminal , the sight of whose execution threw them flat upon their backs in speechless horror ?
neither , my friends .
Belinda sat with great dignity at the head , her hands genteelly holding a pink cambric pocket-handkerchief in her lap .
and Bab contentedly surveyed the gill of skim-milk which was to satisfy the thirst of the company .
it makes me mad to have them all shut up there , when we might have such fun with them .
and Bab twisted round to give it a thump with her boots .
this awful threat calmed Bab 's anger at once , and she hastened to introduce a safer subject .
flat upon their faces lay the fourteen dolls , and the cake , the cherished cake , was gone .
for an instant the little girls could only stand motionless , gazing at the dreadful scene .
I 'll give it to her !
you run that way .
I 'll run this .
Betty puckered up her face to cry , but burst out laughing in spite of her woe .
my poor Linda was knocked right over on her nose .
a yellow-bird sat swinging and chirping on the tall lilac-bush , but no other living thing was in sight .
I should just like to know who is laughing and sneezing round here .
he did so , but took it in again to say quickly ,
there 's only this .
tell the truth , and I 'll stand by you .
I was to stay in the museum and help Pedro with the trick business .
but father didn't send for me , and I began to have horrid times .
but I 'd have starved if it hadn't been for Sanch .
I left him tied up when I ran off , for fear they 'd say I stole him .
he belongs to father , and I hated to leave him ; but I did .
he always has one in the summer , and I haven't seen any round yet .
never saw such a bed .
it 's such fun to go jouncing down the lane and back .
what 's the matter now ?
bears used to be plenty , but folks got tired of them .
my man will show you where to drive them , and give you some odd jobs through the day .
I 'll see what you are good for , and send you word to-night , Mrs Moss .
I will , sir .
he 's to take the cows and go for them .
was he cross ?
did you have to work hard ?
the old gentleman wasn't cross ; he gave me a dime , and I like him first-rate .
what are these chaps up to ?
the ink has spoilt all but the picture and this bit of reading .
I want to know what it means .
on the shore were unclad copper-colored men , gazing with wonder at the Spanish ships .
who was he any way ?
let me read while I drive up the cows .
you 'll find a cunning place between the roots that stick up under the flat stone .
that 's my closet , and I keep things there .
Betty doesn't know much about sums .
but she spells splendidly , and is always at the head of her class .
I saw lots of names on the shed door .
I can't make such curly ones .
father was real proud when I read it right off .
she also proposed that they should drop patch-work , and help her make some blue shirts for Ben .
now he saw nothing before him but days of patient and very uninteresting labor .
at the school-house corner he stopped and said , spreading his arms like a sign-post ,
I 'll bring you a book all about it when I come back .
suppose you come to tea with me to-night and bring some of them back ?
can't we wear our Sunday frocks ?
and she likes dolls .
would you like to work for me instead of the Squire ?
that will be one thing you can do .
another is to take care of his pets till he is able to do it himself .
he is fourteen , and appears to get taller and taller every day .
he was also allowed to drive home , while his new mistress read her letters .
I am all ready , however , and we will sit down at once .
this is my brother Thornton , and we are all going to be very good friends by-and-by .
at last , a moment came when temptation proved too strong for him .
before Miss Celia could speak , the stranger calmly announced his mission .
I am Alfred Tennyson Barlow .
I don't learn any Greeks and Latins yet .
I made another one when I digged after the turtle .
I will say that .
sweet , sweet days are passing O'er my happy home .
cold are the days when winter comes again .
and , without another word , the discomfited poet precipitately retired , leaving his cherished sticks behind him .
at sight of that , Betty stretched out her arms to receive it with a cry of delight .
he had also been a conjurer , and now was supported by Blanche and her daughter Lyda .
then we spelt some words wrong , and she corrected them with wonderful accuracy .
also mental arithmetic , which was very pretty .
Lyda was beaten , and hid under the sofa , evidently feeling very badly about it .
I 'll hunt it up to-night .
she is so nicely asleep , it is a pity to wake her .
and Miss Celia 's eyes turned to the deep sky , where early stars were shining .
there was no need of any more words , no need of tears or kind arms around him .
he knew he was an orphan now , and turned instinctively to the old friend who loved him best .
throwing himself down beside his dog , Ben clung about the curly neck , sobbing bitterly ,
presently the sobbing ceased , and Ben whispered , without looking up ,
he 's awful hard to me and Sanch ; and he 'd be worse , now father 's gone .
don't send me back !
God doesn't mind our clothes , Ben , and the poor are as welcome as the rich to him .
I often do so , and we will go to the grove this afternoon and try it .
I never saw such a chap as that spider is .
I like to watch him .
but it was not good for you , and we will do our best to find something safer .
you won't need boots for a week yet , so we won't waste any time over them .
it 's dreadful hard , though , when I get mad .
so he folded his arms and sat like a statue , with nothing moving but his eyes .
Ben laughed , and said , with an affectionate glance at the little book in her lap ,
wasn't David a fine feller ?
come over about four and help me roll Thorny down to the grove .
Randa has gone on with the hammock .
I learned it when I was six .
and Thorny offered the book like a patriarch addressing an infant .
you learn that , and see how funny Celia will look when you say it to her .
she wrote it when she was a girl , and somebody had it printed for other children .
how can I keep a sunny soul To shine along life 's way ?
you must say them to Celia , too .
I 'll tell you all about it some time .
I talked , and Ben learned a hymn to please you .
every one was very kind to Ben when his loss was known .
the Squire wrote to Mr Smithers that the boy had found friends and would stay where he was .
you write well enough , and it will be good for you to know something about botany .
Pistils , more than one and separate .
don't forget day and date .
while Sam read , the other boys had been gloating over the enticing pictures which covered the bill .
down it jumped and Came fluttering up , much elated at being summoned by the captain of the sacred nine .
you just catch hold of this and run along home .
I 'd like to see her walking eight miles .
no , Bab , you can't go .
don't you be a donkey , Bill .
folks are going in now .
I ain't afraid .
I picked some of that , it was so green and pretty .
don't touch it !
we 've quit the business and must just look on .
folks always like it , and I was ever so proud of him .
Many left in haste , and the performers hurried to finish as soon as possible .
see , they are pulling in the cart now , and the shiny man is all ready with his gun .
I 'll walk right home this minute .
I ain't afraid of thunder , and the rain won't hurt these old clothes .
I walked over , and it 's raining , and I don't feel well .
Sam got a ride , and can't you tuck Ben and Bab in too ?
Ben whistled , called and searched in vain , till one of the lounging men said , lazily ,
wagons passed , but all were full , and no one offered a ride .
he said I couldn't .
ah , ha !
you may have any of mine you like .
guess we 'll have an auction and sell out .
would Jack be a comfort to you ?
if he will , you may have him .
I 'll find that dog , if he is out of the ground .
Addio , signorina !
Grazia , signor !
Cousin Horace had done his duty like a man , but regretted that he could only report a failure .
I 'll bet he ran away ; and if it was Sanch , he 'll come home .
but weeks passed , and still no Sanch .
something has happened to Miss Celia , and I 'm going to find her .
what shall I do ?
Lita tried not to hurt me .
she slipped , and we went down .
what 's broke ?
where is she ?
why didn't she come right here ?
fetch her right in .
father 's down yender , and he and Bijah will see to her .
Dr Mills is a master hand for broken bones and old Dr Babcock ain't .
people jogging along in wagons and country carry-alls stared amazed as the reckless pair went by .
I felt as if I had six legs when we were going the pace .
I spoke it at school .
I declare I wish that dog had never been born !
losing him has just spoilt Ben .
do you think he would slip away without telling us , and go back to the old life again ?
don't believe he would .
if he is planning to run away , money is a good thing to have .
let us wait a little and give the poor boy a chance to clear himself before we speak .
he 's a sly little dog , and knows my eye is on him .
she was just going down to breakfast when the sound of loud voices made her pause and listen .
it came from Ben 's room , where the two boys seemed to be disputing about something .
they weren't so kind , but they trusted me , and knew I wouldn't steal a cent .
the lower ones have seldom been opened since we came , and hold only some of papa 's old books .
it always stuck so I had to give a jerk .
ain't they funny ?
look just like mites of young pigs .
as they spoke , Miss Celia and her brother held out their hands frankly and heartily .
I do not wonder , and I 've been thinking what I could do to soothe his feelings .
but won't you give him something ?
shall I get the books when I buy the other things ?
let her tuck her dolly in , and she will be contented anywhere .
we must have a rope to lead him , for he 's got no collar and no muzzle .
you just let him in , to see what he 'll do .
See , his pretty , pink skin is all stained with it .
if the interesting sufferer could only have spoken , what thrilling adventures and hair-breadth escapes he might have related .
but , alas ! he was dumb ; and the secrets of that memorable month never were revealed .
out of one of these stories came much amusement for all , and satisfaction for one of the party .
the bows are in the long box where you found the mallets , fishing-rods , and bats .
the old quivers and a few arrows are there also , I believe .
come on , Ben .
people missed Matty , but supposed she was with her father , and never expected to see her again .
they are big boys , and we can't make them stop .
he says he 'll fight his own battles , and hates tell-tales .
but I 've got to settle Sam .
Sam broke down in his attempt to give one of Webster 's great speeches , Little Cy Fay boldly attacked
but , to their great surprise , the pretty lady stood up again and said , in her friendly way ,
I heard about it .
my papa told me what arching meant .
will there be any little cakes ?
with these opening remarks the poet took a seat and calmly awaited a response .
I have been very busy .
I had measles .
my mamma says so .
I am fond of dirt .
various rules and regulations were discussed , and then the fun began .
Miss Celia wouldn't like it .
you worked harder than I did , and it was only luck my getting this .
the question was settled by the appearance of the wolf in the second scene , and such a wolf !
but what they heard only whetted their curiosity and mystified them more and more .
roosting here , Sam began to shout for aid in every key possible to the human voice .
I 'm in the ma'sh .
he follows your lead , and if you tell him to stop it he will .
if I was big enough , I 'd make you hold your tongues .
now , bring on a rail , there 's a good fellow .
I will !
Celia has been packed and ready for a week .
then we kept meeting , and the first thing I knew she went and was engaged to him .
I shall go to college , so I don't mind .
George is going to help the old minister here and see how he likes it .
I know he wouldn't want to , and Miss Celia would feel bad .
Sancho trotted before and saw the stranger first , for the sun in Ben 's eyes dazzled him .
go bring him here .
come right in and make yourself to home .
Thanky , ma'am .
I 'll look up the concern and try my chance .
but , on the whole , it is best not to say a word about it .
these good folks are making a gentleman of you , and I won't be the one to spoil their work .
and , before Ben could reply , he was gone .
will you see that it is done , and all made neat afterward ?
but where was Bab , who revelled in flurries ?
we can't do much , but we can make our little sacrifices , and ought to do it gladly .
we 've each got a dollar , and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving that .
and Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time .
don't you wish we had the money Papa lost when we were little , Jo ?
well , I think we are .
Jo immediately sat up , put her hands in her pockets , and began to whistle .
I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy .
and it 's worse than ever now , for I 'm dying to go and fight with Papa .
it 's too bad , but it can't be helped .
I like your nice manners and refined ways of speaking , when you don't try to be elegant .
what the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out .
we must go shopping tomorrow afternoon , Meg .
if I can go down easily , I 'll drop .
if I can't , I shall fall into a chair and be graceful .
Hagar , the witch , chanted an awful incantation over her kettleful of simmering toads , with weird effect .
I always wanted to do the killing part .
has anyone called , Beth ?
how is your cold , Meg ?
Jo , you look tired to death .
the girls flew about , trying to make things comfortable , each in her own way .
a quick , bright smile went round like a streak of sunshine .
he is well , and thinks he shall get through the cold season better than we feared .
In this one little was said of the hardships endured , the dangers faced , or the homesickness conquered .
everybody sniffed when they came to that part .
we ought to have our roll of directions , like Christian .
it was uninteresting sewing , but tonight no one grumbled .
at nine they stopped work , and sang , as usual , before they went to bed .
Meg had a voice like a flute , and she and her mother led the little choir .
they had always done this from the time they could lisp
and it had become a household custom , for the mother was a born singer .
Jo was the first to wake in the gray dawn of Christmas morning .
then she opened her new book and began to read .
Amy came in hastily , and looked rather abashed when she saw her sisters all waiting for her .
thank you for our books .
I 'm glad you began at once , and hope you will keep on .
but I want to say one word before we sit down .
Meg was already covering the buckwheats , and piling the bread into one big plate .
they were soon ready , and the procession set out .
how the big eyes stared and the blue lips smiled as the girls went in .
in a few minutes it really did seem as if kind spirits had been at work there .
that was a very happy breakfast , though they didn't get any of it .
strike up , Beth !
open the door , Amy !
Beth played her gayest march , Amy threw open the door , and Meg enacted escort with great dignity .
the big chamber was the scene of many innocent revels .
presently a bell sounded , the curtains flew apart , and the operatic tragedy began .
Hugo demanded a potion to make Zara adore him , and one to destroy Roderigo .
hither , hither , from thy home , Airy sprite , I bid thee come !
bring me here , with elfin speed , The fragrant philter which I need .
make it sweet and swift and strong , Spirit , answer now my song !
take the magic spell , And use it well , Or its power will vanish soon !
and dropping a small , gilded bottle at the witch 's feet , the spirit vanished .
it was truly superb .
kneeling at the foot of the tower , he sang a serenade in melting tones .
this dauntless example fired Zara .
Don Pedro refuses , because he is not rich .
and Meg smiled her sweetest , in spite of her gray beard and white eyebrows .
he is an odd old gentleman , but that pleased him .
he 's a capital fellow , and I wish we could get acquainted .
we invited him to our party , but he didn't come .
perhaps he 'll help act .
and Meg examined her flowers with great interest .
Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news .
yours is as good as new , but I forgot the burn and the tear in mine .
whatever shall I do ?
the front is all right .
I don't care much for company dancing .
she said when you spoiled the others that she shouldn't get you any more this winter .
that 's all I can do .
only don't stain it , and do behave nicely .
what have you done ?
I 'm spoiled !
I can't go !
you shouldn't have asked me to do it .
I always spoil everything .
as the gate clashed behind them , a voice cried from a window
is my sash right ?
I 'll lift my eyebrows if any thing is wrong , and nod if you are all right .
I never can .
she telegraphed her wish to Meg , but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir .
I wish every one would say Jo instead of Josephine .
and Jo resigned herself with a sigh .
both peeped and criticized and chatted till they felt like old acquaintances .
nothing but grinding or skylarking .
you may laugh , if you want to .
but Laurie didn't laugh .
that stupid high heel turned and gave me a sad wrench .
I 'm sorry .
it 's past nine , and dark as Egypt .
I can't stop here , for the house is full .
Sallie has some girls staying with her .
don't ask or tell anyone .
I 'll stay with you .
and there was Laurie , with a full cup in one hand and a plate of ice in the other .
I was looking for someone to give this to .
I 'll show you where she is .
please let me take you home .
Laurie and I couldn't help laughing .
Jo told her adventures , and by the time she had finished they were at home .
and I think Jo was quite right .
Beth had a headache and lay on the sofa , trying to comfort herself with the cat and three kittens .
Amy was fretting because her lessons were not learned , and she couldn't find her rubbers .
Jo would whistle and make a great racket getting ready .
the poor things got no other lunch and were seldom home before two .
goodbye , Marmee .
and Jo tramped away , feeling that the pilgrims were not setting out as they ought to do .
but Meg laughed at the nonsense and felt better in spite of herself .
thank goodness , I can always find something funny to keep me up .
Jo 's ambition was to do something very splendid .
Beth was too bashful to go to school .
she had to wear her cousin 's clothes .
Meg was Amy 's confidant and monitor , and by some strange attraction of opposites Jo was gentle Beth 's .
I did my very best , and she liked it , though she only said
what a pleasant life she might have if only she chose !
they sat still as mice , and Susie cried quarts , I know she did .
she was so glad and surprised she took it right into her arms , and thanked him over and over .
I 'd go myself , if I was any use .
I 'd given one man and thought it too much , while he gave four without grudging them .
can't keep still all day , and not being a pussycat , I don't like to doze by the fire .
now , the garden separated the Marches ' house from that of Mr Laurence .
a low hedge parted the two estates .
he needs a party of jolly boys to play with , or somebody young and lively .
the idea amused Jo , who liked to do daring things and was always scandalizing Meg by her queer performances .
and when the snowy afternoon came , Jo resolved to try what could be done .
it 's a shame !
Laurie opened the window , and croaked out as hoarsely as a raven
I 'll go ask her .
tell the girl to put it away for your tea .
yes , that 's what it wanted .
I 'll talk all day if you 'll only set me going .
her face is right opposite , and it looks so sweet behind the flowers , I can't help watching it .
and Laurie poked the fire to hide a little twitching of the lips that he could not control .
the solitary , hungry look in his eyes went straight to Jo 's warm heart .
her face was very friendly and her sharp voice unusually gentle as she said
I just wish , though , instead of peeping , you 'd come over and see us .
Meg and I would make you laugh over our funny stage properties , and we 'd have jolly times .
we want to know you , and I 've been trying to do it this ever so long .
never mind being bashful .
I 'm only afraid you are very tired of talking to me .
Laurie went away , and his guest amused herself in her own way .
that answer pleased the old gentleman .
and Jo told how her visit came about .
that was the boy 's affair .
I shall come and see your mother some fine day .
tell her so .
there 's the tea bell , we have it early on the boy 's account .
and Mr Laurence offered her his arm with old-fashioned courtesy .
but finding them free and easy , she was so herself , and made a good impression .
too many sugarplums are not good for him .
his music isn't bad , but I hope he will do as well in more important things .
going ? well , I 'm much obliged to you , and I hope you 'll come again .
when they got into the hall , Jo asked Laurie if she had said something amiss .
he shook his head .
I am not a young lady , and it 's only a step .
they both died when Laurie was a little child , and then his grandfather took him home .
and Jo opened her eyes as if it had never occurred to her before .
all sorts of pleasant things happened about that time , for the new friendship flourished like grass in spring .
what good times they had , to be sure .
God bless you , my dear !
and away he went , in a great hurry .
she never knew that Mr Laurence opened his study door to hear the old-fashioned airs he liked .
at any rate she deserved both .
he is so kind to me , I must thank him , and I don't know any other way .
it will please him very much , and be a nice way of thanking him .
she was a nimble little needlewoman , and they were finished before anyone got tired of them .
Beth hurried on in a flutter of suspense .
don't you think he 's the dearest old man in the world ?
here 's the key in the letter .
I can't , I feel so queer !
Jo opened the paper and began to laugh , for the first words she saw were
just think , he 's given you her piano .
only think of his writing that to you .
I 'll tell the girls .
the pianny has turned her head !
they would have been still more amazed if they had seen what Beth did afterward .
if the roof of the house had suddenly flown off , the old gentleman wouldn't have been more astonished .
but he liked it .
and Meg looked sober .
are limes the fashion now ?
and Meg tried to keep her countenance , Amy looked so grave and important .
if one girl likes another , she gives her a lime .
you may have my share .
it must be so nice to have pocket money !
I 'll have a grand feast , for I haven't tasted a lime this week .
Katy Brown invited her to her next party on the spot .
pride goes before a fall , and the revengeful Snow turned the tables with disastrous success .
it was a most unfortunate moment for denouncing Amy , and Jenny knew it .
unfortunately , Mr Davis particularly detested the odor of the fashionable pickle , and disgust added to his wrath .
with a despairing glance at her set , she obeyed .
all flashed indignant or appealing glances at the inexorable Davis , and one passionate lime lover burst into tears .
that hiss , faint as it was , irritated the irascible gentleman , and sealed the culprit 's fate .
that was dreadful .
I wish all the girls would leave , and spoil his old school .
you were whispering and laughing together on the sofa last night , and you stopped when I came in .
Amy held her tongue , but used her eyes , and saw Meg slip a fan into her pocket .
I know !
please let me .
I 've been sick with this cold so long , and shut up , I 'm dying for some fun .
do , Meg !
or he 'll get another seat for you , and that isn't proper when you weren't asked .
when they got home , they found Amy reading in the parlor .
there Jo was mistaken , for next day she made a discovery which produced a tempest .
Amy poked the fire and said nothing .
Jo saw her color rise and was down upon her in a minute .
and Jo gave her a slight shake .
with that she marched off to bed , and there was no merry or confidential gossip that night .
Jo still looked like a thunder cloud , and nothing went well all day .
Amy heard the clash of skates , and looked out with an impatient exclamation .
she promised I should go next time , for this is the last ice we shall have .
it was not far to the river , but both were ready before Amy reached them .
Jo saw her coming , and turned her back .
as Laurie turned the bend , he shouted back
Jo heard , but Amy was struggling to her feet and did not catch a word .
Jo glanced over her shoulder , and the little demon she was harboring said in her ear
she tried to call Laurie , but her voice was gone .
something rushed swiftly by her , and Laurie 's voice cried out
I only let her go .
it seems as if I could do anything when I 'm in a passion .
I get so savage , I could hurt anyone and enjoy it .
and for the moment Jo forgot remorse in surprise .
she felt comforted at once by the sympathy and confidence given her .
then your father came , and I was so happy that I found it easy to be good .
it was easier to try for your sakes than for my own .
you have had a warning .
but you must help me , remind me , and keep me from flying out .
the violet silk would be so nice .
I didn't like to say anything , but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella .
it 's a nonsensical notion of mine , and I 'm not going to give up to it .
my silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort .
you are a dear to lend me yours , Jo .
and Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box .
the next day was fine , and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure .
so out came the tarlatan , looking older , limper , and shabbier than ever beside Sallie 's crisp new one .
the hard , bitter feeling was getting pretty bad , when the maid brought in a box of flowers .
who are they from ?
she enjoyed herself very much that evening , for she danced to her heart 's content .
everyone was very kind , and she had three compliments .
Annie made her sing , and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice .
her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard .
something in the manner of her friends struck Meg at once .
where is the use of having a lot of dresses when she isn't out yet ?
several young ladies , who had taken no notice of her before , were very affectionate all of a sudden .
she heard Mrs Moffat reply to one of them 
the girls dressed me up for fun , and I rather like it .
I wanted you to see her , but they have spoiled her entirely .
come , I 'll be good .
you don't look as if you were having a good time .
and Laurie looked at her with an expression which made her answer in a whisper ...
don't think I 'm horrid .
Meg danced and flirted , chattered and giggled , as the other girls did .
for motherly eyes are quick to see any change in children 's faces .
don't I always tell you everything ?
Laurie thought I wasn't proper .
and Jo laughed , as if on second thoughts the thing struck her as a good joke .
to be admired , loved , and respected .
leave these things to time .
Meg 's had roses and heliotrope , myrtle , and a little orange tree in it .
poetic fire lights up his eye , He struggles ' gainst his lot .
behold ambition on his brow , And on his nose , a blot .
Knights and ladies , elves and pages , monks and flower girls , all mingled gaily in the dance .
Yonder he comes , arrayed like a bridegroom , except the black mask .
curiosity and wonder possessed all hearts , but respect restrained all tongues till the holy rite was over .
then the eager spectators gathered round the count , demanding an explanation .
it is full of unruly members .
one day in October , when they were ripe , he picked one and took it to market .
a grocerman bought and put it in his shop .
on Friday last , we were startled by a violent shock in our basement , followed by cries of distress .
Hannah Brown will preside , and all are invited to attend .
the latest Paris fashions have arrived , and orders are respectfully solicited .
if S.P. didn't use so much soap on his hands , he wouldn't always be late at breakfast .
a loud response from Snodgrass , followed , to everybody 's surprise , by a timid one from Beth .
up rose Snodgrass , very much in earnest .
this spirited burst from Beth electrified the club , and Jo left her seat to shake hands approvingly .
a long discussion followed , and everyone came out surprising , for everyone did her best .
the Kings are off to the seashore tomorrow , and I 'm free .
I didn't hear any more , for I basely turned and fled .
I want to learn some new songs , and my children need fitting up for the summer .
they all drank it merrily , and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day .
next morning , Meg did not appear till ten o'clock .
Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating , and got a raging headache by reading too long .
but these were mere trifles , and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely .
she didn't like dolls , fairy tales were childish , and one couldn't draw all the time .
tea parties didn't amount to much , neither did picnics , unless very well conducted .
it 's a very queer thing for her to do , she doesn't act a bit like herself .
Many were the complaints below , and great the chagrin of the head cook at her failures .
we 'll have lettuce and make a salad .
and Jo went off in a huff at the doubts expressed of her powers .
oh , Pip !
having rekindled the fire , she thought she would go to market while the water heated .
by the time she got cleared up , the dinner arrived and the stove was red-hot .
Miss Crocker tasted first , made a wry face , and drank some water hastily .
they did sober themselves for Beth 's sake .
work is wholesome , and there is plenty for everyone .
never mind , the other may be found .
my letter is only a translation of the German song I wanted .
and hanging the antique broad-brim on a bust of Plato , Jo read her letters .
one from her mother made her cheeks glow and her eyes fill , for it said to her 
my Dear :
that 's worth millions of money and pecks of praise .
oh , Marmee , I do try !
in a big , dashing hand , Laurie wrote
I want you all to come , can't let Beth off at any price , and nobody shall worry her .
Laurie knew them abroad , and liked the boys .
I shall row and tramp about , so I don't want any starch to think of .
but I don't want to play , or sing , or say anything .
you do try to fight off your shyness , and I love you for it .
each had made such preparation for the fete as seemed necessary and proper .
I see Mrs Barker doing up the lunch in a hamper and a great basket .
now Mr Laurence is looking up at the sky and the weathercock .
I wish he would go too .
there 's Laurie , looking like a sailor , nice boy !
Laurie didn't tell us that .
be quick , girls !
it 's getting late .
I thought he was at the mountains .
there is Sallie .
I 'm glad she got back in time .
it 's too absurd !
Laurie ran to meet and present them to his friends in the most cordial manner .
the lawn was the reception room , and for several minutes a lively scene was enacted there .
Jo 's funny hat deserved a vote of thanks , for it was of general utility .
Mr Brooke was a grave , silent young man , with handsome brown eyes and a pleasant voice .
Frank , Beth , Amy , and Grace sat down to watch the game played by the other eight .
Mr Brooke chose Meg , Kate , and Fred .
Laurie took Sallie , Jo , and Ned .
Jo and Fred had several skirmishes and once narrowly escaped high words .
Fred was close behind her and his turn came before hers .
he gave a stroke , his ball hit the wicket , and stopped an inch on the wrong side .
I saw you .
it rolled a bit , perhaps , but that is allowed .
goodbye , Kate .
he did cheat , I saw him .
this is no credit to me , you know , I don't do anything .
I brought Authors , and I dare say Miss Kate knows something new and nice .
go and ask her .
at last he resolved to get into the castle and ask how he could help them .
he went and knocked .
so the diver hoisted it up , and was much disappointed on opening it to find no pearls .
peeping over the hedge , he saw the queen of his affections picking flowers in her garden .
he tried to climb over the hedge , but it seemed to grow higher and higher .
Beth had disappeared behind Jo , and Grace was asleep .
with practice we might do something quite clever .
and Jo gave a disdainful shrug as the rest laughed at Laurie 's matter-of-fact tone .
her turn came next .
and she slyly smiled in his disappointed face .
now , Miss Sallie , you shall have a chance without waiting to draw .
and Mr Brooke laid his book on her lap with an inviting smile .
there was a queer smile about Mr Brooke 's mouth as he opened at poor Mary 's lament .
I advise you to learn , for German is a valuable accomplishment to teachers .
what odd people these Yankees are .
what shall I do ?
an impromptu circus , fox and geese , and an amicable game of croquet finished the afternoon .
Ned , getting sentimental , warbled a serenade with the pensive refrain
he looked at Meg with such a lackadiasical expression that she laughed outright and spoiled his song .
peeping through the meshes of the hammock , he saw the Marches coming out , as if bound on some expedition .
they can't be going in the boat , for they haven't got the key .
perhaps they forgot it .
Amy was sketching a group of ferns , and Jo was knitting as she read aloud .
bring on your bears .
and Laurie sat down with a submissive expression delightful to behold .
I wanted to amuse him one night when you were all away , and he was rather dismal .
the sun was low , and the heavens glowed with the splendor of an autumn sunset .
I shall have to do a deal of traveling before I come in sight of your Celestial City .
that 's my favorite castle .
every one of us , but Beth , wants to be rich and famous , and gorgeous in every respect .
you mustn't talk in that way , and Laurie mustn't take your bad advice .
if you have been good , he looks satisfied and walks briskly .
so you keep an account of my good and bad marks in Brooke 's face , do you ?
don't be angry , and oh , don't tell him I said anything !
I didn't mean to preach or tell tales or be silly .
I only thought Jo was encouraging you in a feeling which you 'd be sorry for by-and-by .
and Meg offered her hand with a gesture both affectionate and timid .
Jo 's desk up here was an old tin kitchen which hung against the wall .
Laurie burst out with a hearty boy 's laugh , which made several passers-by smile in spite of themselves .
it 's grand fun and will straighten you up capitally .
I don't like Ned and his set , and wish you 'd keep out of it .
mother won't let us have him at our house , though he wants to come .
Just be a simple , honest , respectable boy , and we 'll never desert you .
I don't know what I should do if you acted like Mr King 's son .
all about people you know , and such fun !
you ought to hear it , and I 've been aching to tell it this long time .
you get everything you want out of people .
why , Jo , your stories are works of Shakespeare compared to half the rubbish that is published every day .
Laurie bent , and whispered three words in Jo 's ear , which produced a comical change .
it 's ridiculous , it won't be allowed .
don't try to make me grow up before my time , Meg .
it 's hard enough to have you change all of a sudden .
it was very splendid , and they have gone to spend the winter in Paris .
in a few minutes Jo bounced in , laid herself on the sofa , and affected to read .
I knew it !
it was good practice , he said , and when the beginners improved , anyone would pay .
Meg sighed , and turned to the frostbitten garden again .
it 's our day for a letter , and the postman hasn't been .
a sharp ring interrupted her , and a minute after Hannah came in with a letter .
come at once .
S HALE Blank Hospital , Washington .
the next train goes early in the morning .
the horses are ready .
on the way get these things .
I 'll put them down , they 'll be needed and I must go prepared for nursing .
hospital stores are not always good .
Beth , go and ask Mr Laurence for a couple of bottles of old wine .
I 'm not too proud to beg for Father .
he shall have the best of everything .
but the last was impossible .
I didn't beg , borrow , or steal it .
it will be good for my vanity , I was getting too proud of my wig .
it will do my brains good to have that mop taken off .
the work put into it made it dear , and so on .
so I begged him to take it , and told him why I was in such a hurry .
I never snivel over trifles like that .
Beth went to the piano and played the father 's favorite hymn .
it 's only the vain part of me that goes and cries in this silly way .
don't tell anyone , it 's all over now .
in the cold gray dawn the sisters lit their lamp and read their chapter with an earnestness never felt before .
Hannah is faithfulness itself , and our good neighbor will guard you as if you were his own .
go on with your work as usual , for work is a blessed solace .
the rattle of an approaching carriage made them all start and listen .
that was the hard minute , but the girls stood it well .
coffee was a treat , and Hannah showed great tact in making it that morning .
no one could resist her persuasive nods , or the fragrant invitation issuing from the nose of the coffee pot .
the girls are all as good as gold .
Jo helps me with the sewing , and insists on doing all sorts of hard jobs .
Beth is as regular about her tasks as a clock , and never forgets what you told her .
Amy minds me nicely , and I take great care of her .
she does her own hair , and I am teaching her to make buttonholes and mend her stockings .
she tries very hard , and I know you will be pleased with her improvement when you come .
Hannah is a perfect saint .
my precious Marmee :
Brooke was a trump to telegraph right off , and let us know the minute he was better .
didn't that do as well as a regular prayer ?
you 'd laugh to see Meg head the table and try to be motherish .
she gets prettier every day , and I 'm in love with her sometimes .
I freed my mind about a silly little thing , and he was offended .
I declared I wouldn't and got mad .
it lasted all day .
I felt bad and wanted you very much .
Laurie and I are both so proud , it 's hard to beg pardon .
but I thought he 'd come to it , for I was in the right .
I met him at the gate , coming for the same thing .
we both laughed , begged each other 's pardon , and felt all good and comfortable again .
the busy mind has no time to think Of sorrow or care or gloom .
and anxious thoughts may be swept away , As we bravely wield a broom .
everyone is very kind , and we are as happy as we can be without you .
Amy wants the rest of the page , so I must stop .
I didn't forget to cover the holders , and I wind the clock and air the rooms every day .
kiss dear Father on the cheek he calls mine .
oh , do come soon to your loving
adieu , I send heaps of love to Papa .
your affectionate daughter
Miss Meg is going to make a proper good housekeeper .
Beth is the best of little creeters , and a sight of help to me , bein so forehanded and dependable .
Amy does well without frettin , wearin her best clothes and eatin sweet stuff .
dear Madam :
the little girls are all well .
Beth and my boy report daily .
Hannah is a model servant , and guards pretty Meg like a dragon .
Glad the fine weather holds .
don't let your husband want anything .
for a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood .
Amy found that housework and art did not go well together , and returned to her mud pies .
Beth kept on , with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving .
Mrs Hummel goes away to work , and Lottchen takes care of it .
Beth spoke earnestly , and Meg promised she would go tomorrow .
So Beth lay down on the sofa , the others returned to their work , and the Hummels were forgotten .
an hour passed .
he said it was dead , and looked at Heinrich and Minna , who have sore throats .
she never had it , and I should hate to give it to her .
and Beth leaned her head against her sister with a contented look , which effectually settled that point .
the baby 's death troubled her , but I dare say she has only got cold .
aunt March received them with her usual hospitality .
Laurie retired to the window , and Jo told her story .
and , Jo , you 'd better go at once .
Beth did have the fever , and was much sicker than anyone but Hannah and the doctor suspected .
everyone missed Beth .
she doesn't look like my Beth , and there 's nobody to help us bear it .
soon she dried the tears which had relieved her , and looked up with a grateful face .
now she won't feel so bad about leaving him .
Beth is my conscience , and I can't give her up .
I can't !
it isn't like you to be forlorn .
stop a bit .
you are a good doctor , Teddy , and such a comfortable friend .
we thought Hannah was overdoing the authority business , and your mother ought to know .
she 'd never forgive us if Beth 
well , if anything happened , you know .
I 'll do it by proxy , when your grandpa comes .
everything appeared to feel the hopeful change .
every one rejoiced but Beth .
the house was still as death , and nothing but the wailing of the wind broke the deep hush .
an hour went by , and nothing happened except Laurie 's quiet departure for the station .
praise be given !
before the girls could believe the happy truth , the doctor came to confirm it .
while these things were happening at home , Amy was having hard times at Aunt March 's .
then she was allowed one hour for exercise or play , and didn't she enjoy it ?
ah , no !
I know it , Madame confides in me .
but I wish she 'd let us have them now .
oh , I 'll be a lamb , if I can only have that lovely ring !
it 's ever so much prettier than Kitty Bryant 's .
and Amy tried on the blue ring with a delighted face and a firm resolve to earn it .
but , Amy was a young pilgrim , and just now her burden seemed very heavy .
get along , you fright !
hold your tongue !
kiss me , dear !
I poked it out , and it ran under the bookcase .
to my father , my best pictures , sketches , maps , and works of art , including frames .
I wish my favorite playmate Kitty Bryant to have the blue silk apron and my gold-bead ring with a kiss .
I forgive everyone , and trust we may all meet when the trump shall sound .
Estelle Valnor , Theodore Laurence .
then he amused her for an hour , and was much interested in all her trials .
what a strange yet pleasant day that was .
aunt gave me the ring today .
she gave that funny guard to keep the turquoise on , as it 's too big .
wear your ring , dear , and do your best .
I think you will prosper , for the sincere wish to be good is half the battle .
now I must go back to Beth .
now Meg does not do anything of the sort .
I know you 'll take his part .
it would be idiotic !
I knew there was mischief brewing .
I felt it , and now it 's worse than I imagined .
I see it all !
they 'll go lovering around the house , and we shall have to dodge .
oh , dear me !
Jo leaned her chin on her knees in a disconsolate attitude and shook her fist at the reprehensible John .
if she and John love one another , they can wait , and test the love by doing so .
she is conscientious , and I have no fear of her treating him unkindly .
my pretty , tender hearted girl !
don't make plans , Jo , but let time and their own hearts mate your friends .
I wish wearing flatirons on our heads would keep us from growing up .
I 'm going to bed .
I 've done nothing !
Do let me bring that wicked boy over to explain and be lectured .
let me handle this , for it is worse than I thought .
I 'll comfort Meg while you go and get Laurie .
Meg received his humble apology , and was much comforted by the assurance that Brooke knew nothing of the joke .
Jo immediately knocked again .
could I ask what 's the matter ?
and the injured youth finished his sentence by an energetic gesture of the right arm .
as I couldn't , I held my tongue , and bore the scolding till the old gentleman collared me .
I 'm not going to be lectured and pummelled by everyone , just for a bit of a frolic .
I 'll go to Washington and see Brooke .
you go and surprise your father , and I 'll stir up old Brooke .
it would be a glorious joke .
let's do it , Jo .
we 'll leave a letter saying we are all right , and trot off at once .
I 've got money enough .
sit down and think of your own sins , don't go making me add to mine .
don't try to shield him .
I know he has been in mischief by the way he acted when he came home .
he shall not shelter himself behind a promise from you softhearted girls .
if he 's done anything amiss , he shall confess , beg pardon , and be punished .
mother forbade it .
it was partly my fault , but it 's all right now .
Jo was sorry for that speech the minute it was made .
where 's your respect for me , and your proper bringing up ?
bless the boys and girls !
he likes fun , and this way is better than talking .
the note was written in the terms which one gentleman would use to another after offering some deep insult .
I got it all round .
like sunshine after a storm were the peaceful weeks which followed .
several days of unusually mild weather fitly ushered in a splendid Christmas Day .
God bless you , dear Queen Bess !
Laurie opened the parlor door and popped his head in very quietly .
Jo disgraced herself by nearly fainting away , and had to be doctored by Laurie in the china closet .
but it was too late .
I 'll try to sing the song of the shepherd boy which the Pilgrims heard .
but something was needed , and the elder ones felt it , though none confessed the fact .
you are not like your old self a bit , and seem ever so far away from me .
but the instant she vanished , Meg began to sidle toward the door , murmuring
I only want to know if you care for me a little , Meg .
this was the moment for the calm , proper speech , but Meg didn't make it .
this nettled her .
I don't want to be worried about such things .
I 'll wait and say nothing till you have had more time .
don't play with me , Meg .
that boy 's tutor ?
I know all about it .
Jo blundered into a wrong message in one of your Father 's letters , and I made her tell me .
he 'll hear .
tell me , do you mean to marry this Cook ?
is that the way you take my advice , Miss ?
you ought to marry well and help your family .
aunt March took no notice , but went on with her lecture .
we are willing to work and we mean to wait .
no , I won't stop .
don't expect anything from me when you are married .
your Mr Brooke 's friends must take care of you .
and slamming the door in Meg 's face , Aunt March drove off in high dudgeon .
at the odd sound the lovers turned and saw her .
how much has happened since I said that !
it 's all right you see .
don't you wish you could take a look forward and see where we shall all be then ?
so the curtain falls upon Meg , Jo , Beth , and Amy .
