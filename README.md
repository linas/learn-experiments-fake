Experimental configration data
------------------------------

This repo contains config files for running the language-learning
pipeline, as well as occasional scripts and data. The summary of
results can be found in:

https://github.com/opencog/learn/learn-lang-diary-part-two.lyx
and
https://github.com/opencog/learn/notes

Although config files get checked into git, the older runs are then
deleted (as documented below) to minimize clutter.

A quick guide:

* expt-1, expt-2 - Never checked into git. Pipeline commisioning.
* expt-3 through expt-9 - Pipeline commisioning, first science runs.
